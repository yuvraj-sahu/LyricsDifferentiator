taylor_swift	It feels like a perfect night
taylor_swift	To dress up like hipsters
taylor_swift	And make fun of our exes
taylor_swift	Ah-ah, ah-ah
taylor_swift	It feels like a perfect night
taylor_swift	For breakfast at midnight
taylor_swift	To fall in love with strangers
taylor_swift	Ah-ah, ah-ah
taylor_swift	Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
taylor_swift	It's miserable and magical
taylor_swift	Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
taylor_swift	It's time, oh-oh
taylor_swift	I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
taylor_swift	Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
taylor_swift	You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
taylor_swift	Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
taylor_swift	Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two
taylor_swift	It seems like one of those nights
taylor_swift	This place is too crowded
taylor_swift	Too many cool kids (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew.)
taylor_swift	Ah-ah, ah-ah
taylor_swift	It seems like one of those nights
taylor_swift	We ditch the whole scene
taylor_swift	And end up dreaming instead of sleeping
taylor_swift	Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
taylor_swift	It's miserable and magical
taylor_swift	Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
taylor_swift	It's time, oh-oh
taylor_swift	I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
taylor_swift	Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
taylor_swift	You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
taylor_swift	Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
taylor_swift	Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (I don't know about you)
taylor_swift	Twenty-two, twenty-two
taylor_swift	It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
taylor_swift	It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping
taylor_swift	It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
taylor_swift	I gotta have you, I gotta have you
taylor_swift	Ooh, ooh, yeah, hey!
taylor_swift	I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
taylor_swift	(I don't know about you)
taylor_swift	Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
taylor_swift	You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
taylor_swift	(You don't know about me)
taylor_swift	Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
taylor_swift	(Dance like we're)
taylor_swift	Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (oh-woah-oh)
taylor_swift	Twenty-two (dancing like)
taylor_swift	Twenty-two (yeah, yeah)
taylor_swift	Twenty-two (yeah, yeah, yeah)
taylor_swift	It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene
taylor_swift	It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we won't be sleeping
taylor_swift	It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), you look like bad news
taylor_swift	I gotta have you, I gotta have you
taylor_swift	You said you were smarter 
taylor_swift	I said just look at my report card 
taylor_swift	You said you know more 
taylor_swift	I said u know less then a door 
taylor_swift	That's when I get to say 
taylor_swift	I'm an 8th grade graduate 
taylor_swift	Your a 6th grade idiot 
taylor_swift	Don't you wish you were an 8th graduate!
taylor_swift	One, two, three, four,
taylor_swift	Before I know it, I'm out the door
taylor_swift	Five, six, seven, eight,
taylor_swift	Oh, why, didn't I, wait?
taylor_swift	Nine and ten, 
taylor_swift	I sure do regret, then
taylor_swift	Oh wait! 
taylor_swift	For another chance
taylor_swift	You need,
taylor_swift	To take a risk
taylor_swift	So hey,
taylor_swift	Just wait!  Before it is too late,
taylor_swift	Just take, a chance
taylor_swift	So tell, me why,
taylor_swift	It takes me time,
taylor_swift	To wonder how,
taylor_swift	How I got this far
taylor_swift	But why, didn't I wait?
taylor_swift	There was a chance, I needed to take!
taylor_swift	Oh wait!
taylor_swift	For another chance,
taylor_swift	You need,
taylor_swift	To take a little risk
taylor_swift	So hey!
taylor_swift	Just wait! 
taylor_swift	Before it's too late
taylor_swift	Just take, a chance
taylor_swift	:
taylor_swift	So imagine, what it would be like,
taylor_swift	If we never took risks,
taylor_swift	Or we never had a chance
taylor_swift	To
taylor_swift	Live
taylor_swift	La la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la ohh oh
taylor_swift	Oh wait! 
taylor_swift	For another chance
taylor_swift	You need,
taylor_swift	To take a risk
taylor_swift	So hey,
taylor_swift	Just wait! 
taylor_swift	Before it is too late,
taylor_swift	Just take, a chance 
taylor_swift	Ohh oh
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
taylor_swift	Maybe I should've seen the signs
taylor_swift	Should've read the writing on the wall
taylor_swift	And realised by the distance in your eyes
taylor_swift	That I would be the one to fall
taylor_swift	No matter what you say
taylor_swift	I still can't believe
taylor_swift	That you would walk away
taylor_swift	It don't make sense to me, but:
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
taylor_swift	It's not unbroken anymore
taylor_swift	How do I get it back the way it was before?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
taylor_swift	I don't know what I want,
taylor_swift	So, don't ask me,
taylor_swift	'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
taylor_swift	Don't know what's down this road
taylor_swift	I'm just walking,
taylor_swift	Trying to see through the rain coming down
taylor_swift	Even though I'm not the only one,
taylor_swift	Who feels the way I do
taylor_swift	I'm alone,
taylor_swift	On my own,
taylor_swift	And that's all I know
taylor_swift	I'll be strong,
taylor_swift	I'll be wrong,
taylor_swift	Oh, but life goes on
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm just a girl,
taylor_swift	Trying to find a place in this world
taylor_swift	Got the radio on
taylor_swift	My old blue jeans,
taylor_swift	And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
taylor_swift	Feeling lucky today,
taylor_swift	Got the sunshine,
taylor_swift	Could you tell me what more do I need
taylor_swift	And tomorrow's just a mystery,
taylor_swift	Oh yeah, but, that's okay
taylor_swift	I'm alone,
taylor_swift	On my own,
taylor_swift	And that's all I know
taylor_swift	I'll be strong,
taylor_swift	I'll be wrong,
taylor_swift	Oh, but life goes on
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm just a girl,
taylor_swift	Trying to find a place in this world
taylor_swift	Maybe I'm just a girl, 
taylor_swift	On a mission
taylor_swift	But, I'm ready to fly
taylor_swift	I'm alone,
taylor_swift	On my own,
taylor_swift	And that's all I know
taylor_swift	I'll be strong,
taylor_swift	I'll be wrong,
taylor_swift	Oh, but life goes on
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm alone,
taylor_swift	On my own
taylor_swift	And that's all I know
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm just a girl
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm just a girl
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm just a girl
taylor_swift	The way you look, the way you laugh
taylor_swift	The way you love with all you have
taylor_swift	There ain't nothing about you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	The way you kiss, the way you cry
taylor_swift	The way you move when you walk by
taylor_swift	There's ain't nothing about you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	Once I thought that love was something I could never do
taylor_swift	Never knew that I could feel this much
taylor_swift	But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
taylor_swift	Is more than a reaction to your touch
taylor_swift	It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
taylor_swift	The way you look, the way you laugh
taylor_swift	The way you love with all you have
taylor_swift	There ain't nothing about you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	The way you kiss, the way you cry
taylor_swift	The way you move when you walk by
taylor_swift	There's ain't nothing about you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
taylor_swift	In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
taylor_swift	That never knocked me off my feet
taylor_swift	All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
taylor_swift	And baby, it's no mystery why I surrender
taylor_swift	Boy, you got everything
taylor_swift	The way you look, the way you laugh
taylor_swift	The way you love with all you have
taylor_swift	There ain't nothing about you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	The way you kiss, the way you cry
taylor_swift	The way you move when you walk by
taylor_swift	There's ain't nothing about you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	I love your attitude, all your tattoos
taylor_swift	Your every thought, your smile, your lips
taylor_swift	And boy, the list goes on and on, and on
taylor_swift	The way you look, the way you laugh
taylor_swift	The way you love with all you have
taylor_swift	There's ain't nothing about you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	The way you kiss, the way you cry
taylor_swift	The way you move when you walk by
taylor_swift	There's ain't nothing 'bout you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	The way you look, the way you laugh
taylor_swift	The way you love with all you have
taylor_swift	Your dance, your drive
taylor_swift	You make me feel alive
taylor_swift	Right now I think you see
taylor_swift	There ain't nothing about you
taylor_swift	That don't do something for me
taylor_swift	I wake up, I stretch out
taylor_swift	I wonder what you're doing right now
taylor_swift	Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
taylor_swift	Tell myself I must be crazy, 
taylor_swift	Thinking about him
taylor_swift	I find myself something decent to wear
taylor_swift	Take the towel out of my hair
taylor_swift	About that time, you call me
taylor_swift	And I'm reminded, without you I'd be
taylor_swift	A stranger in an all night diner
taylor_swift	Waiting for her love to find her
taylor_swift	Lonely like a harbor line
taylor_swift	Thats never seen a boat
taylor_swift	Just like a line in an old love letter 
taylor_swift	No one wrote
taylor_swift	I go to work, work all day
taylor_swift	I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
taylor_swift	Walk to my car, dig out my keys
taylor_swift	Start thinking if you were with anyone but me
taylor_swift	A stranger in an all night diner
taylor_swift	Waiting for her love to find her
taylor_swift	Lonely like a harbor line
taylor_swift	Thats never seen a boat
taylor_swift	Just like a line in an old love letter 
taylor_swift	No one wrote
taylor_swift	There you are, on the street
taylor_swift	Standing there all waiting on me
taylor_swift	Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
taylor_swift	You say you love em, and baby without you,
taylor_swift	I'd be
taylor_swift	A stranger in an all night diner
taylor_swift	Waiting for her love to find her
taylor_swift	Lonely like a harbor line
taylor_swift	Thats never seen a boat
taylor_swift	Just like a line in an old love letter 
taylor_swift	No one wrote
taylor_swift	I wake up, I stretch out
taylor_swift	Wonder what you're doing right now
taylor_swift	I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
taylor_swift	But something about it felt like home somehow
taylor_swift	And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
taylor_swift	And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
taylor_swift	Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
taylor_swift	We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
taylor_swift	Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
taylor_swift	And I can picture it after all these days
taylor_swift	And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
taylor_swift	And I might be okay but Im not fine at all...
taylor_swift	'Cause there we are again on that little town street
taylor_swift	You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin over at me
taylor_swift	Wind in my hair, I was there
taylor_swift	I remember it all too well
taylor_swift	Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
taylor_swift	You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
taylor_swift	And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
taylor_swift	You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
taylor_swift	And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
taylor_swift	And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...
taylor_swift	'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
taylor_swift	We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
taylor_swift	Down the stairs, I was there
taylor_swift	I remember it all too well
taylor_swift	Well, maybe we got lost in translation
taylor_swift	Maybe I asked for too much
taylor_swift	But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
taylor_swift	Till you tore it all up
taylor_swift	Running scared, I was there
taylor_swift	I remember it all too well
taylor_swift	And you call me up again
taylor_swift	Just to break me like a promise
taylor_swift	So casually cruel
taylor_swift	In the name of being honest
taylor_swift	I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
taylor_swift	'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well
taylor_swift	Time won't fly
taylor_swift	It's like I'm paralyzed by it
taylor_swift	I'd like to be my old self again
taylor_swift	But I'm still trying to find it
taylor_swift	After plaid shirt days
taylor_swift	And nights when you made me your own
taylor_swift	Now you mail back my things
taylor_swift	And I walk home alone
taylor_swift	But you keep my old scarf
taylor_swift	From that very first week
taylor_swift	'Cause it reminds you of innocence
taylor_swift	And it smells like me
taylor_swift	You can't get rid of it
taylor_swift	'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
taylor_swift	'Cause there we are again
taylor_swift	Where I loved you so
taylor_swift	Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
taylor_swift	It was rare, I was there
taylor_swift	I remember it all too well
taylor_swift	Wind in my hair, you were there
taylor_swift	You remember it all
taylor_swift	Down the stairs, you were there
taylor_swift	You remember it all
taylor_swift	It was rare, I was there
taylor_swift	I remember it all too well
taylor_swift	People like you always want back
taylor_swift	The love they gave away
taylor_swift	And people like me wanna believe you
taylor_swift	When you say you've changed
taylor_swift	The more I think about it now
taylor_swift	The less I know
taylor_swift	All I know is that you drove us
taylor_swift	Off the road
taylor_swift	(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
taylor_swift	Had me in the palm of your hand
taylor_swift	Then, why you had to go and lock me out
taylor_swift	While I let you in?
taylor_swift	(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it
taylor_swift	Back now that it's just too late
taylor_swift	Well could've been easy
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	Here you are now, calling me up
taylor_swift	But I don't know what to say
taylor_swift	I've been picking up the pieces
taylor_swift	Of the mess you made
taylor_swift	People like you always want back
taylor_swift	The love they pushed aside
taylor_swift	But people like me are gone forever
taylor_swift	When you say goodbye
taylor_swift	(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
taylor_swift	Had me in the palm of your hand
taylor_swift	Then, why you had to go and lock me out
taylor_swift	While I let you in?
taylor_swift	(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it
taylor_swift	Back now that it's just too late
taylor_swift	Well could've been easy
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	Let me remind you this was what you wanted
taylor_swift	You're in the air
taylor_swift	You were all I wanted
taylor_swift	But not like this
taylor_swift	Not like this
taylor_swift	Not like this
taylor_swift	Oh, all you had to do was (stay)
taylor_swift	Hey, all you had to do was stay
taylor_swift	Had me in the palm of your hand
taylor_swift	Then, why you had to go and lock me out
taylor_swift	While I let you in?
taylor_swift	(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it
taylor_swift	Back now that it's just too late
taylor_swift	Well could've been easy
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay)
taylor_swift	Hey, all you had to do was stay

taylor_swift	(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it
taylor_swift	Back now that it's just too late
taylor_swift	Well could've been easy
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay)
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay) 
taylor_swift	All you had to do was (stay)
taylor_swift	Sometimes I wonder 
taylor_swift	How its gonna feel 
taylor_swift	Will my first love be true and real 
taylor_swift	Will I be ready when 
taylor_swift	My heart starts to fall 
taylor_swift	What will I do when my love comes to call 
taylor_swift	And my daddy tells me 
taylor_swift	That I light up his world 
taylor_swift	Everyday he says "Darlin, 
taylor_swift	You're my best girl" 
taylor_swift	He tried to teach me 
taylor_swift	From the very start 
taylor_swift	The meaning of love 
taylor_swift	So nobody breaks my heart 
taylor_swift	Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
taylor_swift	Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
taylor_swift	Will my love come in the pourin' rain? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the joy? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the pain? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the boy? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for love? 
taylor_swift	For love 
taylor_swift	I know I'm not a little 
taylor_swift	Girl anymore 
taylor_swift	Cuz I'm feeling things 
taylor_swift	I've never felt before 
taylor_swift	Sweet sensations 
taylor_swift	And anticipations 
taylor_swift	Calling commotion 
taylor_swift	To my emotions 
taylor_swift	And I hear the words 
taylor_swift	My daddy says to me 
taylor_swift	He said "be true to yourself 
taylor_swift	And keep your spirit free 
taylor_swift	And love will find you 
taylor_swift	One way or another 
taylor_swift	Be good to yourself 
taylor_swift	And be good to each other" 
taylor_swift	Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
taylor_swift	Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
taylor_swift	Will my love come in the pourin' rain? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the joy? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the pain? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the joy? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the pain? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for love? 
taylor_swift	Its a run around the world 
taylor_swift	And its moving so fast 
taylor_swift	Though I wanna find 
taylor_swift	A love thats gonna last 
taylor_swift	A love so strong 
taylor_swift	That it can withstand 
taylor_swift	The weight of the world 
taylor_swift	In the palm of its hand 
taylor_swift	Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
taylor_swift	Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
taylor_swift	Will my love come in the pourin' rain? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the joy? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the pain? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the joy? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the pain? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for this game? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the kiss? 
taylor_swift	Am i ready for the stars? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for the bliss? 
taylor_swift	Am I ready for love?
taylor_swift	American boy, living life as it goes
taylor_swift	Sittin' on the fence posts
taylor_swift	Living in the lie
taylor_swift	American boy, living in the real world
taylor_swift	Trying just to get the girl
taylor_swift	Trying to survive
taylor_swift	The simple things in life are always new
taylor_swift	Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
taylor_swift	Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
taylor_swift	The greatest living hero that ever was
taylor_swift	Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
taylor_swift	The hope of an american boy
taylor_swift	Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
taylor_swift	Looking for the love
taylor_swift	Suddenly rise, an american beauty
taylor_swift	Suddenly he cheats, sent from above
taylor_swift	The simple things in life are always new
taylor_swift	Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
taylor_swift	Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
taylor_swift	The greatest living hero that ever was
taylor_swift	Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
taylor_swift	The dream of an american boy
taylor_swift	American boy, raising little babies
taylor_swift	Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
taylor_swift	Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
taylor_swift	That's grown up, american boy
taylor_swift	The simple things in life are always new
taylor_swift	Growing up on Grandview avenue
taylor_swift	Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
taylor_swift	The greatest living hero that ever was
taylor_swift	Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
taylor_swift	No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
taylor_swift	The hope of an american boy
taylor_swift	Well she was an American girl
taylor_swift	Raised on promises
taylor_swift	She couldn't help thinking that there
taylor_swift	Was a little more to life
taylor_swift	Somewhere else
taylor_swift	After all it was a great big world
taylor_swift	With lots of places to run to
taylor_swift	Yeah, and if she had to die
taylor_swift	Tryin-she had one little promise
taylor_swift	She was gonna keep
taylor_swift	Oh yeah, all right
taylor_swift	Take it easy baby
taylor_swift	Make it last all night
taylor_swift	She was an American girl
taylor_swift	Well it was kind of cold that night
taylor_swift	She stood alone on her balcony
taylor_swift	And she could the cars roll by
taylor_swift	Out on 441
taylor_swift	Like waves crashin on the beach
taylor_swift	And for one desperate moment there
taylor_swift	He crept back in her memory
taylor_swift	God it's so painful
taylor_swift	Something that's so close
taylor_swift	And still so far out of reach
taylor_swift	Oh yeah, all right
taylor_swift	You take it easy baby
taylor_swift	Make it last all night
taylor_swift	She was an American girl
taylor_swift	Oh yeah, all right
taylor_swift	Take it easy baby
taylor_swift	Make it last all night
taylor_swift	Oh yeah, all right
taylor_swift	Take it easy baby
taylor_swift	Oh, take it easy now
taylor_swift	Oh yeah, all right
taylor_swift	She was an American girl
taylor_swift	I'm so glad you made time to see me
taylor_swift	How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
taylor_swift	I haven't seen them in a while
taylor_swift	You've been good, busier than ever
taylor_swift	We small talk, work and the weather
taylor_swift	Your guard is up, and I know why
taylor_swift	Because the last time you saw me
taylor_swift	Is still burned in the back of your mind
taylor_swift	You gave me roses, and I left them there to die
taylor_swift	So this is me swallowing my pride
taylor_swift	Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
taylor_swift	And I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
taylor_swift	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
taylor_swift	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
taylor_swift	I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	These days, I haven't been sleeping
taylor_swift	Staying up, playing back myself leaving
taylor_swift	When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
taylor_swift	Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
taylor_swift	I watched you laughing from the passenger side
taylor_swift	And realized I loved you in the fall
taylor_swift	And then the cold came, the dark days
taylor_swift	When fear crept into my mind
taylor_swift	You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye
taylor_swift	So this is me swallowing my pride
taylor_swift	Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
taylor_swift	And I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
taylor_swift	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
taylor_swift	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
taylor_swift	I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
taylor_swift	So good to me, so right
taylor_swift	And how you held me in your arms that September night
taylor_swift	The first time you ever saw me cry
taylor_swift	Maybe this is wishful thinking
taylor_swift	Probably mindless dreaming
taylor_swift	But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
taylor_swift	I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
taylor_swift	So if the chain is on your door, I understand
taylor_swift	And then he said it's too late to apologise
taylor_swift	It's too late
taylor_swift	He said it's too late to apologise
taylor_swift	It's too late
taylor_swift	And I said, this is me swallowing my pride
taylor_swift	Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
taylor_swift	(It's too late to apologise)
taylor_swift	And I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
taylor_swift	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
taylor_swift	(It's too late to apologise)
taylor_swift	He said you're not sorry
taylor_swift	No, no, no
taylor_swift	You're not sorry
taylor_swift	No, no, no
taylor_swift	You're not sorry
taylor_swift	No, no, no
taylor_swift	You're not sorry
taylor_swift	No, no, no
taylor_swift	I like the way you wanted me
taylor_swift	Every night for so long baby
taylor_swift	I like the way you needed me
taylor_swift	Every time things got rocky
taylor_swift	I was believing in you
taylor_swift	Was I mistaken do you mean
taylor_swift	Do you mean what you say
taylor_swift	When you say our love could last forever
taylor_swift	But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
taylor_swift	I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
taylor_swift	I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
taylor_swift	But baby don't you break my heart slow
taylor_swift	I like the way you'd hold me
taylor_swift	Every night for so long baby
taylor_swift	I like the way you'd sing to me
taylor_swift	Every time things got rocky
taylor_swift	I was believing in you
taylor_swift	Was I mistaken do you say
taylor_swift	Do you say what you mean
taylor_swift	When you say our love could last forever
taylor_swift	Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
taylor_swift	I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
taylor_swift	I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
taylor_swift	But baby don't you break my heart slow
taylor_swift	You would run around and lead me on forever
taylor_swift	While I stay at home still thinking we're together
taylor_swift	I wanted our love to last forever
taylor_swift	But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
taylor_swift	I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
taylor_swift	I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
taylor_swift	But baby don't you break my heart slow
taylor_swift	Baby don't you break my heart slow
taylor_swift	I'm so glad you made time to see me
taylor_swift	How's life? Tell me how's your family
taylor_swift	I haven't seen them in a while
taylor_swift	You've been good, busier than ever
taylor_swift	We small talk, work and the weather
taylor_swift	Your guard is up, and I know why
taylor_swift	Because the last time you saw me
taylor_swift	Is still burned in the back of your mind
taylor_swift	You gave me roses, and I left them there to die
taylor_swift	So this is me swallowing my pride
taylor_swift	Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
taylor_swift	And I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
taylor_swift	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
taylor_swift	I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
taylor_swift	I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	These days, I haven't been sleeping
taylor_swift	Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
taylor_swift	When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
taylor_swift	And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
taylor_swift	I watched you laughing from the passenger side
taylor_swift	And realized I loved you in the fall
taylor_swift	And then the cold came
taylor_swift	The dark days when fear crept into my mind
taylor_swift	You gave me all your love
taylor_swift	And all I gave you was "Goodbye"
taylor_swift	So this is me swallowing my pride
taylor_swift	Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
taylor_swift	And I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
taylor_swift	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
taylor_swift	I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
taylor_swift	I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
taylor_swift	So good to me, so right
taylor_swift	And how you held me in your arms that September night
taylor_swift	The first time you ever saw me cry
taylor_swift	Maybe this is wishful thinking
taylor_swift	Probably mindless dreaming
taylor_swift	But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
taylor_swift	I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
taylor_swift	So if the chain is on your door, I understand
taylor_swift	But this is me swallowing my pride
taylor_swift	Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
taylor_swift	And I go back to December...
taylor_swift	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
taylor_swift	Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
taylor_swift	I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
taylor_swift	I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
taylor_swift	I go back to December all the time
taylor_swift	All the time

taylor_swift	Growin' up not wearin' any shoes
taylor_swift	Prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day
taylor_swift	Growin' up the other trailer park girls
taylor_swift	Couldn't hide their jealousy

taylor_swift	Dream about your eyes
taylor_swift	Eyes, eyes...beautiful eyes
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	I know this isn't what I wanted,
taylor_swift	Never thought it'd come this far,
taylor_swift	Just thinking back to where we started
taylor_swift	And how we lost all that we are
taylor_swift	Nick:
taylor_swift	We were young and times were easy,
taylor_swift	But I could see it's not the same.
taylor_swift	I'm standing here but you don't see me,
taylor_swift	I'd give it all for that to change.
taylor_swift	And I dont want to lose her,
taylor_swift	I dont want to let her go.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	I'm standing out in the rain,
taylor_swift	I need to know if its over,
taylor_swift	Cause I will leave you alone.
taylor_swift	Nick:
taylor_swift	Flooded with all this pain,
taylor_swift	Knowing that I'll never hold her,
taylor_swift	Like I did before the storm
taylor_swift	Nick:
taylor_swift	And with every strike of lightning
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Comes a memory that lasts
taylor_swift	Nick Taylor:
taylor_swift	Not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Maybe I should give up
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	I'm standing out in the rain,
taylor_swift	I need to know if its over,
taylor_swift	Cause I will leave you alone.
taylor_swift	Nick:
taylor_swift	Flooded with all this pain,
taylor_swift	Knowing that I'll never hold her,
taylor_swift	Like I did before the storm
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Trying to keep the light from going in
taylor_swift	Nick and Taylor:
taylor_swift	And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
taylor_swift	We always say a heart is not whole without the one who gets you through the storm.
taylor_swift	Standing out in the rain, knowing that it's really over- please don't leave me alone
taylor_swift	Flooded with all this pain, knowing that I'll never hold you, like I did before the storm
taylor_swift	Like I did before the storm
taylor_swift	Took a deep breath in the mirror 
taylor_swift	He didn't like it when I wore high heels
taylor_swift	But I do 
taylor_swift	Turned the lock and put my headphones on 
taylor_swift	He always said he didn't get this song
taylor_swift	But I do, I do 
taylor_swift	Walked in expecting you'd be late 
taylor_swift	But you got here early and you stand and wave
taylor_swift	I walk to you 
taylor_swift	You pulled my chair out and helped me in
taylor_swift	And you don't know how nice that is 
taylor_swift	But I do 
taylor_swift	And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
taylor_swift	I think it's strange that you think Im funny 'cause he never did 
taylor_swift	I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
taylor_swift	Is break and burn and end 
taylor_swift	But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again 
taylor_swift	You said you never met one girl who
taylor_swift	Had as many James Taylor records as you 
taylor_swift	But I do 
taylor_swift	We tell stories and you don't know why
taylor_swift	I'm coming off a little shy 
taylor_swift	But I do 
taylor_swift	But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
taylor_swift	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
taylor_swift	I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
taylor_swift	Is break and burn and end 
taylor_swift	But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again 
taylor_swift	And we walk down the block to my car 
taylor_swift	And I almost brought him up 
taylor_swift	But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
taylor_swift	Every single Christmas
taylor_swift	And I want to talk about that 
taylor_swift	For the first time, what's past is past 
taylor_swift	'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
taylor_swift	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
taylor_swift	I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
taylor_swift	Is break and burn and end 
taylor_swift	But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again 
taylor_swift	But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again
taylor_swift	All is quiet in the world tonight
taylor_swift	Counting stars and fireflies
taylor_swift	This summer sings a lullaby
taylor_swift	Of just me and my baby
taylor_swift	On the hood of his daddy's car
taylor_swift	Pass around his old guitar
taylor_swift	Bet mama's wondering where we are
taylor_swift	Just me and my baby
taylor_swift	The world is spinning 'round
taylor_swift	'Cause of just what I found
taylor_swift	Ooh, life's so sweet right here
taylor_swift	Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
taylor_swift	Ooh, just want to stay right here
taylor_swift	'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
taylor_swift	Driving home by the riverside
taylor_swift	Wishing I could slow down time
taylor_swift	Faking pictures in my mind
taylor_swift	Of me and my baby
taylor_swift	The car pulls up and I'm home too late
taylor_swift	We didn't take that interstate
taylor_swift	The back road was a better way
taylor_swift	For me and my baby
taylor_swift	The closer that we get
taylor_swift	Ooh, I can't leave yet
taylor_swift	Ooh, life's so sweet right here
taylor_swift	Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
taylor_swift	Ooh, just want to stay right here
taylor_swift	'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
taylor_swift	Both know what we found
taylor_swift	So we turned that car around
taylor_swift	Ooh, life's so sweet right here
taylor_swift	Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
taylor_swift	Ooh, just want to stay right here
taylor_swift	Ooh, and be with my baby
taylor_swift	Ooh, yeah and be with my baby
taylor_swift	Her hair is Harlow gold
taylor_swift	Her lips are sweet surprise
taylor_swift	Her hands are never cold
taylor_swift	She got Bette Davis eyes
taylor_swift	She'll turn her music on
taylor_swift	You won't have to think twice
taylor_swift	She's pure as New York snow
taylor_swift	She got Bette Davis eyes
taylor_swift	And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
taylor_swift	All the better just to please you
taylor_swift	She's precocious and she knows just
taylor_swift	What it takes to make a pro blush
taylor_swift	She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs
taylor_swift	She got Bette Davis eyes
taylor_swift	She'll let you take her home
taylor_swift	It whets her appetite
taylor_swift	She'll lay you on her throne
taylor_swift	She got Bette Davis eyes
taylor_swift	She'll take a tumble on you
taylor_swift	Roll you like you were dice
taylor_swift	Until you come out blue
taylor_swift	She's got Bette Davis eyes
taylor_swift	She'll expose you when she blows you
taylor_swift	Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
taylor_swift	She's ferocious and she knows just
taylor_swift	What it takes to make a pro blush
taylor_swift	All the boys think she's a spy
taylor_swift	She's got Bette Davis eyes
taylor_swift	And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
taylor_swift	All the better just to please you
taylor_swift	She's ferocious, and she knows just
taylor_swift	What it takes to make a pro blush
taylor_swift	All the boys think she's a spy
taylor_swift	She's got Bette Davis eyes
taylor_swift	She's got Bette Davis eyes
taylor_swift	Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did.
taylor_swift	The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
taylor_swift	And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
taylor_swift	She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
taylor_swift	She took him faster than you can say sabotage
taylor_swift	I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
taylor_swift	I underestimated just who I was dealing with
taylor_swift	She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
taylor_swift	She underestimated just who she was stealing from
taylor_swift	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
taylor_swift	She's an actress, woah
taylor_swift	She's better known for the things that she does
taylor_swift	On the mattress, woah
taylor_swift	Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
taylor_swift	Won't make you many friends
taylor_swift	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
taylor_swift	There is nothing I do better than revenge
taylor_swift	She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list 
taylor_swift	She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
taylor_swift	I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
taylor_swift	She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
taylor_swift	But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
taylor_swift	Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
taylor_swift	They don't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
taylor_swift	But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
taylor_swift	(Think about what you did.)
taylor_swift	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
taylor_swift	She's an actress, woah
taylor_swift	She's better known for the things that she does
taylor_swift	On the mattress, woah
taylor_swift	Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
taylor_swift	Won't make you many friends
taylor_swift	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
taylor_swift	There is nothing I do better than revenge
taylor_swift	I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
taylor_swift	You might have him, but haven't you heard?
taylor_swift	I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
taylor_swift	You might have him, but I always get the last word
taylor_swift	Woah...
taylor_swift	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
taylor_swift	She's an actress, woah
taylor_swift	She's better known for the things that she does
taylor_swift	On the mattress, woah
taylor_swift	Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
taylor_swift	Won't make you many friends
taylor_swift	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
taylor_swift	There is nothing I do better than revenge
taylor_swift	Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
taylor_swift	'Cause I don't think you do
taylor_swift	Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
taylor_swift	I don't think you do
taylor_swift	I don't think you do
taylor_swift	Let's hear the applause
taylor_swift	Come on, show me how much better you are
taylor_swift	See you deserve some applause
taylor_swift	'Cause you're so much better!
taylor_swift	She took him faster than you can say sabotage...
taylor_swift	Nice to meet you, where you been?
taylor_swift	I could show you incredible things
taylor_swift	Magic, madness, heaven, sins
taylor_swift	Saw you there and I thought
taylor_swift	"Oh my God, look at that face!"
taylor_swift	You look like my next mistake
taylor_swift	Love's a game, wanna play?
taylor_swift	New money, suit and tie
taylor_swift	I can read you like a magazine
taylor_swift	Ain't it funny, rumors fly
taylor_swift	And I know you heard about me
taylor_swift	So hey, let's be friends
taylor_swift	I'm dying to see how this one ends
taylor_swift	Grab your passport and my hand
taylor_swift	I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
taylor_swift	So it's gonna be forever
taylor_swift	Or it's gonna go down in flames
taylor_swift	You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
taylor_swift	If the high was worth the pain
taylor_swift	Got a long list of ex-lovers
taylor_swift	They'll tell you I'm insane
taylor_swift	'Cause you know I love the players
taylor_swift	And you love the game
taylor_swift	'Cause we're young and we're reckless
taylor_swift	We'll take this way too far
taylor_swift	It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
taylor_swift	Or with a nasty scar
taylor_swift	Got a long list of ex-lovers
taylor_swift	They'll tell you I'm insane
taylor_swift	But I got a blank space, baby
taylor_swift	And I'll write your name
taylor_swift	Cherry lips, crystal skies
taylor_swift	I could show you incredible things
taylor_swift	Stolen kisses, pretty lies
taylor_swift	You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
taylor_swift	Find out what you want
taylor_swift	Be that girl for a month
taylor_swift	Wait, the worst is yet to come
taylor_swift	Oh no
taylor_swift	Screaming, crying, perfect storms
taylor_swift	I can make all the tables turn
taylor_swift	Rose garden filled with thorns
taylor_swift	Keep you second-guessing like
taylor_swift	"Oh my God, who is she?"
taylor_swift	I get drunk on jealousy
taylor_swift	But you'll come back each time you leave
taylor_swift	'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
taylor_swift	So it's gonna be forever
taylor_swift	Or it's gonna go down in flames
taylor_swift	You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
taylor_swift	If the high was worth the pain
taylor_swift	Got a long list of ex-lovers
taylor_swift	They'll tell you I'm insane
taylor_swift	'Cause you know I love the players
taylor_swift	And you love the game
taylor_swift	'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
taylor_swift	We'll take this way too far
taylor_swift	It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
taylor_swift	Or with a nasty scar
taylor_swift	Got a long list of ex-lovers
taylor_swift	They'll tell you I'm insane
taylor_swift	But I got a blank space, baby
taylor_swift	And I'll write your name
taylor_swift	Boys only want love if it's torture
taylor_swift	Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
taylor_swift	Boys only want love if it's torture
taylor_swift	Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
taylor_swift	So it's gonna be forever
taylor_swift	Or it's gonna go down in flames
taylor_swift	You can tell me when it's over (over)
taylor_swift	If the high was worth the pain
taylor_swift	Got a long list of ex-lovers
taylor_swift	They'll tell you I'm insane
taylor_swift	'Cause you know I love the players
taylor_swift	And you love the game
taylor_swift	'Cause we're young and we're reckless
taylor_swift	We'll take this way too far (ooh)
taylor_swift	It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
taylor_swift	Or with a nasty scar
taylor_swift	Got a long list of ex-lovers
taylor_swift	They'll tell you I'm insane
taylor_swift	But I got a blank space, baby
taylor_swift	And I'll write your name
taylor_swift	I see your face in my mind as I drive away
taylor_swift	'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
taylor_swift	People are people and sometimes we change our minds
taylor_swift	But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
taylor_swift	Mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm 
taylor_swift	Mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm 
taylor_swift	Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie 
taylor_swift	It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
taylor_swift	'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
taylor_swift	Now I don't know what to be without you around
taylor_swift	And we know it's never simple, never easy
taylor_swift	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
taylor_swift	You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
taylor_swift	And I can't breathe
taylor_swift	Without you, but I have to
taylor_swift	Breathe
taylor_swift	Without you, but I have to
taylor_swift	Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
taylor_swift	Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
taylor_swift	But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
taylor_swift	Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
taylor_swift	And we know it's never simple, never easy
taylor_swift	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
taylor_swift	You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
taylor_swift	And I can't breathe
taylor_swift	Without you, but I have to
taylor_swift	Breathe
taylor_swift	Without you, but I have to
taylor_swift	Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
taylor_swift	Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
taylor_swift	Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
taylor_swift	Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
taylor_swift	And we know it's never simple, never easy
taylor_swift	Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh
taylor_swift	I can't breathe
taylor_swift	Without you, but I have to
taylor_swift	Breathe
taylor_swift	Without you, but I have to
taylor_swift	Breathe
taylor_swift	Without you, but I have to
taylor_swift	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
taylor_swift	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
taylor_swift	Here you are now
taylor_swift	Fresh from your war
taylor_swift	Back from the edge of time
taylor_swift	And all that you were
taylor_swift	Stripped to the bone
taylor_swift	I thought you'd want to know
taylor_swift	That when you feel the world is crashing
taylor_swift	All around your feet
taylor_swift	Come running headlong into my arms
taylor_swift	Breathless
taylor_swift	I'll never judge you
taylor_swift	I can only love you
taylor_swift	Come now running headlong
taylor_swift	Into my arms
taylor_swift	Breathless
taylor_swift	Lay down your guns
taylor_swift	Too weak to run
taylor_swift	Nothing can harm you here
taylor_swift	Your precious heart
taylor_swift	Broken and scarred
taylor_swift	Somehow you made it through
taylor_swift	I only ask that you won't go again
taylor_swift	When you feel the world is crashing
taylor_swift	All around your feet
taylor_swift	Come running headlong into my arms
taylor_swift	Breathless
taylor_swift	I'll never judge you
taylor_swift	I can only love you
taylor_swift	Come now running headlong
taylor_swift	Into my arms
taylor_swift	Breathless
taylor_swift	I'm so glad to see you smiling
taylor_swift	So good to hear your laugh
taylor_swift	I think that you've found you even
taylor_swift	Missed yourself
taylor_swift	I'm only asking this because I think that
taylor_swift	Truth be told
taylor_swift	Oh, you'll never go again
taylor_swift	Again
taylor_swift	When you feel the world is crashing
taylor_swift	All around your feet
taylor_swift	Come running headlong into my arms
taylor_swift	Breathless
taylor_swift	I'll never judge you
taylor_swift	I can only love you
taylor_swift	Come now running headlong
taylor_swift	Into my arms
taylor_swift	Breathless
taylor_swift	Breathless
taylor_swift	Emily comes home from school,
taylor_swift	Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
taylor_swift	He says "baby girl what's wrong with you?"
taylor_swift	She says "please don't make me go back there again"
taylor_swift	She said "I wish there was some way
taylor_swift	To make them stop it"
taylor_swift	So he drives down to
taylor_swift	That principle's office and says
taylor_swift	"I didn't bring her up
taylor_swift	So they could cut her down
taylor_swift	I didn't bring her here
taylor_swift	So they could shut her out
taylor_swift	I live my whole damn life
taylor_swift	To see that little girl's smile
taylor_swift	So why are tears pouring down
taylor_swift	That sweet face?
taylor_swift	She wasn't brought up that way"
taylor_swift	Emily's home late again
taylor_swift	He sees that boy drive away
taylor_swift	Oh, but something different this time,
taylor_swift	She doesn't have too much to say
taylor_swift	She said "he tried but
taylor_swift	There's just some things I won't do"
taylor_swift	And through the tears
taylor_swift	She said "I couldn't do that to you"
taylor_swift	And he said
taylor_swift	"I didn't bring you up
taylor_swift	So he could wear
taylor_swift	You down
taylor_swift	Take that innocent heart
taylor_swift	And turn it inside out
taylor_swift	I live my whole damn life
taylor_swift	To see my little girl's smile
taylor_swift	So don't let nobody take that away,
taylor_swift	You weren't brought up that way"
taylor_swift	The phone rings on a rainy night
taylor_swift	Says "it's Officer Tate"
taylor_swift	He said "sir, there's been an accident,
taylor_swift	You better come down here right away,
taylor_swift	A drunken driver missed an overpass,
taylor_swift	And Emily, she's fading fast"
taylor_swift	He says "God,I didn't bring her up
taylor_swift	To watch them lay her down
taylor_swift	Nearly killed me the day
taylor_swift	They put her
taylor_swift	Momma in the ground
taylor_swift	Only thing that kept me alive,
taylor_swift	Was that little girl's smile
taylor_swift	So please don't take that away,
taylor_swift	I won't be easy taking her today,
taylor_swift	She wasn't brought up that way"
taylor_swift	He stands over the hospital bed
taylor_swift	Emily opens her eyes
taylor_swift	Well, I saw the things you were doing at the VMAs
taylor_swift	And when I got that video award, you took the mic away
taylor_swift	Now, I'll try to call security with every step I take
taylor_swift	And nothing will even stop with all the music that I ever make
taylor_swift	Don't think you're gonna win this time
taylor_swift	'Cause you better believe that you're not what you do
taylor_swift	I'll get ya! (yeah)
taylor_swift	I'll get ya! (yeah)
taylor_swift	And when I do, Kanye you'll be busted
taylor_swift	I don't wanna be mean to you
taylor_swift	But you better believe me when I tell you that
taylor_swift	You are never what you do
taylor_swift	You're busted. (Busted!)
taylor_swift	Yeah, everybody makes mistakes
taylor_swift	But, this is how it's gonna be until you apologize on the VMAs
taylor_swift	You're busted!
taylor_swift	Any day now
taylor_swift	They're talking war
taylor_swift	I can see the light
taylor_swift	That's in your eyes
taylor_swift	They're not talkin
taylor_swift	A week or two
taylor_swift	Oh, daddy
taylor_swift	Can I go with you?
taylor_swift	Oh, daddy
taylor_swift	Can I go with you?
taylor_swift	You pack a suitcase
taylor_swift	And take a picture
taylor_swift	From the wall
taylor_swift	I always knew
taylor_swift	This time would come
taylor_swift	When I ask how long
taylor_swift	You think
taylor_swift	You're gonna be
taylor_swift	You say
taylor_swift	"Eh, this crazy world's
taylor_swift	Come undone"
taylor_swift	Summer's over
taylor_swift	And leaves begin
taylor_swift	To fall
taylor_swift	And another winter's
taylor_swift	On the way
taylor_swift	I knew
taylor_swift	I wasn't gonna take
taylor_swift	This very well
taylor_swift	But I'd give everything
taylor_swift	To have you here today
taylor_swift	Everyday now
taylor_swift	They're talking war
taylor_swift	I know
taylor_swift	This time has been
taylor_swift	Like it's never
taylor_swift	Been before

taylor_swift	About a week or two
taylor_swift	Oh, daddy
taylor_swift	Can I go with you?
taylor_swift	Oh, daddy
taylor_swift	Can I go with you?
taylor_swift	Oh, daddy
taylor_swift	And its a sad picture, the final blow hits you
taylor_swift	Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
taylor_swift	You know its all the same, another time and place
taylor_swift	Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
taylor_swift	But I believe in whatever you do
taylor_swift	And Ill do anything to see it through
taylor_swift	Because these things will change
taylor_swift	Can you feel it now?
taylor_swift	These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
taylor_swift	This revolution, the time will come
taylor_swift	For us to finally win
taylor_swift	We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah
taylor_swift	So weve been outnumbered
taylor_swift	Raided and now cornered
taylor_swift	Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
taylor_swift	Were getting stronger now
taylor_swift	Find things they never found
taylor_swift	They might be bigger
taylor_swift	But were faster and never scared
taylor_swift	You can walk away, say we dont need this
taylor_swift	But theres something in your eyes
taylor_swift	Says we can beat this
taylor_swift	Because these things will change
taylor_swift	Can you feel it now?
taylor_swift	These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
taylor_swift	This revolution, the time will come
taylor_swift	For us to finally win
taylor_swift	We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah
taylor_swift	Tonight we stand, get off our knees
taylor_swift	Fight for what weve worked for all these years
taylor_swift	And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
taylor_swift	But well stand up champions tonight
taylor_swift	It was the night things changed
taylor_swift	Do you see it now?
taylor_swift	These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
taylor_swift	Its a revolution, throw your hands up
taylor_swift	Cause we never gave in
taylor_swift	And we sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
taylor_swift	Hallelujah
taylor_swift	What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
taylor_swift	Would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings
taylor_swift	Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
taylor_swift	What would happen if God never let it snow
taylor_swift	What would happen if Christmas Carols told a lie
taylor_swift	Tell me what you would find
taylor_swift	You'd say that today holds something special
taylor_swift	Something holy and not superficial
taylor_swift	So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives

taylor_swift	And put a wreath up on your door

taylor_swift	Christmas must be something more
taylor_swift	What if angels did not pay attention to 
taylor_swift	All the things that we wish they would always do

taylor_swift	In a snow covered little town
taylor_swift	Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
taylor_swift	Seasons greetings hope you're well
taylor_swift	I'm doing alright if you were wondering
taylor_swift	Lately I can never tell
taylor_swift	I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
taylor_swift	But there were Christmases when you were mine
taylor_swift	I've been doing fine without you, really
taylor_swift	Up until the nights got cold
taylor_swift	Eveybody's here except you, baby
taylor_swift	Seems like everyon's got someone to hold
taylor_swift	But for me it's just a lonely time
taylor_swift	Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
taylor_swift	Merry Christmas everynbody
taylor_swift	That'll have to be something I just say this year
taylor_swift	Bet you got your mom another sweater
taylor_swift	Were your cousins late again?
taylor_swift	When you were putting up the lights this year
taylor_swift	Did you notice one less pair of hands?
taylor_swift	I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
taylor_swift	But there were Christmases whe I didn't 
taylor_swift	Wonder how you are tonight
taylor_swift	The drought was the very worst, ah ah
taylor_swift	When the flowers that we'd grown
taylor_swift	Together died of thirst
taylor_swift	It was months and months of back and forth, ah ah
taylor_swift	You're still all over me like
taylor_swift	A wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
taylor_swift	Hung my head as I lost the war
taylor_swift	And the sky turn black like a perfect storm
taylor_swift	Rain came pouring down
taylor_swift	When I was drowning
taylor_swift	That's when I could finally breathe
taylor_swift	And by morning
taylor_swift	Gone was any trace of you
taylor_swift	I think I am finally clean
taylor_swift	There was nothing left to do, ah ah
taylor_swift	And the butterflies turned to
taylor_swift	Dust that covered my whole room
taylor_swift	So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
taylor_swift	Let the flood carry away
taylor_swift	All my pictures of you
taylor_swift	The water filled my lungs
taylor_swift	I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
taylor_swift	The rain came pouring down
taylor_swift	When I was drowning
taylor_swift	That's when I could finally breathe
taylor_swift	And by morning
taylor_swift	Gone was any trace of you
taylor_swift	I think I am finally clean
taylor_swift	I think I am finally clean, ah
taylor_swift	Said, I think I am finally clean, ah
taylor_swift	Ten months sober, I must admit
taylor_swift	Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
taylor_swift	Ten months older, I won't give in
taylor_swift	Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
taylor_swift	The drought was the very worst, ah ah
taylor_swift	When the flowers that we'd grown
taylor_swift	Together died of thirst
taylor_swift	Rain came pouring down
taylor_swift	When I was drowning
taylor_swift	That's when I could finally breathe
taylor_swift	And by morning
taylor_swift	Gone was any trace of you
taylor_swift	I think I am finally clean
taylor_swift	Rain came pouring down
taylor_swift	When I was drowning
taylor_swift	That's when I could finally breathe
taylor_swift	And by morning
taylor_swift	Gone was any trace of you
taylor_swift	I think I am finally clean
taylor_swift	Finally clean
taylor_swift	Think that I am finally clean, ah ah
taylor_swift	Think I'm finally clean
taylor_swift	Tweet 
taylor_swift	I drive around this town in a mustang with the top down
taylor_swift	And six running horses under my hood
taylor_swift	Well that's good enough for me
taylor_swift	I don't need the real thing
taylor_swift	That's just another thing for me to try to tame
taylor_swift	I don't know if I could' it might just break me
taylor_swift	I thought there for a little while every sunset
taylor_swift	I'd be riding off with him
taylor_swift	Snap buttons on a denim shirt
taylor_swift	Blue jeans and a little dirt
taylor_swift	That's the closest you'll see me
taylor_swift	Feet hanging out a pickup truck
taylor_swift	Crazy and a little rough' running free
taylor_swift	That's the closest to a cowboy you'll see me
taylor_swift	Before I met him I was so safe and grounded
taylor_swift	Before he taught me how to lie and crawl out the window
taylor_swift	I learned the dirt roads and I got my heart broken
taylor_swift	Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
taylor_swift	And how to let go
taylor_swift	I thought there for a little while every sunset
taylor_swift	I'd be riding off with him
taylor_swift	Snap buttons on a denim shirt
taylor_swift	Blue jeans and a little dirt
taylor_swift	That's the closest you'll see me
taylor_swift	Feet hanging out a pickup truck
taylor_swift	Crazy and a little rough' running free
taylor_swift	That's the closest to a cowboy you'll see me
taylor_swift	It was all a bit wonderful and strange
taylor_swift	But I'll never look at a sunset the same
taylor_swift	Snap buttons on a denim shirt
taylor_swift	Blue jeans and a little dirt
taylor_swift	That's the closest you'll see me
taylor_swift	Feet hanging out a pickup truck
taylor_swift	Crazy and a little rough' running free
taylor_swift	Sitting fishing by the riverbank
taylor_swift	Swimming in the water tank
taylor_swift	That's the closest you'll see me
taylor_swift	Feet hanging out a pickup truck
taylor_swift	Crazy and a little rough' running free
taylor_swift	That's the closest you'll see me
taylor_swift	You have a way of coming easily to me
taylor_swift	And when you take, you take the very best of me
taylor_swift	So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
taylor_swift	And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
taylor_swift	Oh, what a shame
taylor_swift	What a rainy ending, 
taylor_swift	Given to a perfect day
taylor_swift	Just walk away,
taylor_swift	Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
taylor_swift	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
taylor_swift	I've never been anywhere cold as you
taylor_swift	You put up walls,
taylor_swift	And paint them all a shade of grey
taylor_swift	And I stood there loving you,
taylor_swift	And wished them all away
taylor_swift	And you come away with a great little story,
taylor_swift	Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
taylor_swift	Oh, what a shame
taylor_swift	What a rainy ending, 
taylor_swift	Given to a perfect day
taylor_swift	So, just walk away,
taylor_swift	Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
taylor_swift	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
taylor_swift	I've never been anywhere cold as you
taylor_swift	You never did give a damn thing, honey
taylor_swift	But I cried, cried for you
taylor_swift	And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
taylor_swift	If I died, died for you, died for you
taylor_swift	Oh, what a shame
taylor_swift	What a rainy ending, 
taylor_swift	Given to a perfect day
taylor_swift	Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
taylor_swift	Counting all the scars you made
taylor_swift	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
taylor_swift	I've never been anywhere cold as you
taylor_swift	You said it in a simple way
taylor_swift	Four a.m., the second day
taylor_swift	How strange that I don't know you at all
taylor_swift	Stumbled through the long goodbye
taylor_swift	One last kiss then you catch your flight
taylor_swift	Right when I was just about to fall
taylor_swift	I told myself, "Don't get attached."
taylor_swift	But in my mind I play it back
taylor_swift	Spinning faster than the plane that took you
taylor_swift	And this is when the feeling sinks in 
taylor_swift	I don't wanna miss you like this 
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	I guess you're in New York today
taylor_swift	I don't wanna need you this way
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	The delicate, beginning rush
taylor_swift	The feeling you can know so much
taylor_swift	Without knowing anything at all
taylor_swift	And now that I can't put this down
taylor_swift	If I had known what I know now
taylor_swift	I never would've played so nonchalant
taylor_swift	Taxi cabs and busy streets
taylor_swift	That never bring you back to me
taylor_swift	I can't help but wish you took me with you
taylor_swift	And this is when the feeling sinks in 
taylor_swift	I don't wanna miss you like this 
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	I guess you're in London today
taylor_swift	And I don't wanna need you this way
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	This is falling in love in the cruelest way
taylor_swift	This is falling for you when you are worlds away
taylor_swift	In New York, be here
taylor_swift	But you're in London
taylor_swift	And I break down
taylor_swift	This is not fair
taylor_swift	That you're not around
taylor_swift	And this is when the feeling sinks in
taylor_swift	I don't wanna miss you like this
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	I guess you're in New York today
taylor_swift	And I don't wanna need you this way
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	I don't wanna miss you like this
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	Come back, be here
taylor_swift	I could go back,
taylor_swift	To every laugh,
taylor_swift	But, I don't want to go there anymore
taylor_swift	And I know all the steps, 
taylor_swift	Up to your door
taylor_swift	But, I don't wanna go there anymore
taylor_swift	Talk to the wind
taylor_swift	Talk to the sky
taylor_swift	Talk to the man with the reasons why,
taylor_swift	And let me know what you find
taylor_swift	I'll leave my window open,
taylor_swift	'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
taylor_swift	Just know I'm right here hopin'
taylor_swift	That you'll come in with the rain
taylor_swift	I could stand up,
taylor_swift	And sing you a song
taylor_swift	But, I don't want to have to go that far
taylor_swift	And I, I got you down
taylor_swift	I know you by heart,
taylor_swift	And you don't even know where I start
taylor_swift	Talk to yourself
taylor_swift	Talk to the tears
taylor_swift	Talk to the man who put you here,
taylor_swift	And don't wait for the sky to clear
taylor_swift	I'll leave my window open,
taylor_swift	'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
taylor_swift	Just know I'm right here hopin'
taylor_swift	That you'll come in with the rain
taylor_swift	I've watched you so long,
taylor_swift	Screamed your name
taylor_swift	I don't know what else I can say
taylor_swift	But, I'll leave my window open
taylor_swift	'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games
taylor_swift	Just know I'm right here hopin'
taylor_swift	That you'll come in with the rain
taylor_swift	I could go back,
taylor_swift	To every laugh,
taylor_swift	But, I don't want to go there anymore
taylor_swift	I've never gone with the wind
taylor_swift	Just let it flow, let it take me
taylor_swift	Where it wants to go
taylor_swift	'Til you opened the door
taylor_swift	There's so much more
taylor_swift	I'd never seen it before
taylor_swift	I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
taylor_swift	Then you came along and you changed everything
taylor_swift	You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
taylor_swift	You make me crazier, crazier
taylor_swift	Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
taylor_swift	You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
taylor_swift	I watched from a distance as you
taylor_swift	Made life your own, every sky was
taylor_swift	Your own kind of blue
taylor_swift	And I wanted to know
taylor_swift	How that would feel and you made it so real
taylor_swift	You showed me something that I couldn't see
taylor_swift	You opened my eyes and you made me believe
taylor_swift	You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
taylor_swift	You make me crazier, crazier
taylor_swift	Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
taylor_swift	You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
taylor_swift	Baby, you showed me what living is for
taylor_swift	I don't want to hide anymore
taylor_swift	You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
taylor_swift	You make me crazier, crazier
taylor_swift	Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
taylor_swift	You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
taylor_swift	Crazier, Crazier
taylor_swift	Daddy,
taylor_swift	I want you to know
taylor_swift	How my heart aches with your loss
taylor_swift	First your Father
taylor_swift	Now your Mother
taylor_swift	Life's most precious treasure
taylor_swift	?Parents?
taylor_swift	Though they are no longer
taylor_swift	With you on this earth
taylor_swift	They will forever
taylor_swift	Live in the hearts
taylor_swift	Of all who loved them
taylor_swift	I may not be right next to you
taylor_swift	To tell you how much?I love you?
taylor_swift	I may not be right next to you
taylor_swift	To give you a?Hug? of comfort
taylor_swift	Distance is a factor in our relationship
taylor_swift	But you are in my thoughts
taylor_swift	Everyday, from the moment I wake up
taylor_swift	You are in my thoughts
taylor_swift	You are in my heart
taylor_swift	And you are in my prayers
taylor_swift	I can never replace
taylor_swift	The loss of my beloved grandparents
taylor_swift	But as your Daughter
taylor_swift	I will always be here for you
taylor_swift	I am but a phone call away
taylor_swift	And if you close your eyes and think of me
taylor_swift	?Daddy I'm right beside you?
taylor_swift	He said, "I got me a nice new apartment
taylor_swift	In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
taylor_swift	I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
taylor_swift	He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,
taylor_swift	Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
taylor_swift	Won't you come back to me?
taylor_swift	I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
taylor_swift	In dark blue Tennessee
taylor_swift	He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
taylor_swift	He's just hiding out on the other side of town
taylor_swift	With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
taylor_swift	He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,
taylor_swift	Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
taylor_swift	Won't you come back to me?
taylor_swift	I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
taylor_swift	In dark blue Tennessee
taylor_swift	She almost called him on the night that he wrote
taylor_swift	These simple words on his goodbye note
taylor_swift	Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
taylor_swift	Won't you come back to me?
taylor_swift	I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
taylor_swift	In dark blue Tennessee
taylor_swift	In dark blue Tennessee
taylor_swift	This melody is what your love means to me
taylor_swift	I love you so much babe can't  you see
taylor_swift	It is like a rainbow after the thunderstorm
taylor_swift	Your love aways kept me safe and warm,
taylor_swift	You had to walk through that open door
taylor_swift	I suddenly fell down to the floor
taylor_swift	It hurt so much to live without you
taylor_swift	I tried not to think about you
taylor_swift	You were more than I ever had
taylor_swift	My love for you still makes me glad
taylor_swift	So please come back we could start anew
taylor_swift	No more sitting around feeling blue
taylor_swift	So come on, it wil be just me and you
taylor_swift	Don't hesitate
taylor_swift	It would be great 
taylor_swift	It's not too late
taylor_swift	Lets celebrate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
taylor_swift	Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
taylor_swift	Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
taylor_swift	My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine
taylor_swift	You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
taylor_swift	When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
taylor_swift	Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
taylor_swift	Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why
taylor_swift	Dear John
taylor_swift	I see it all now that you're gone
taylor_swift	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
taylor_swift	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
taylor_swift	I should've known
taylor_swift	Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
taylor_swift	Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
taylor_swift	And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
taylor_swift	And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
taylor_swift	Dear John
taylor_swift	I see it all now that you're gone
taylor_swift	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
taylor_swift	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
taylor_swift	Dear John
taylor_swift	I see it all now, it was wrong
taylor_swift	Don't you think nineteen's too young 
taylor_swift	To be played by your dark, twisted games?
taylor_swift	When I loved you so
taylor_swift	I should've known
taylor_swift	You are an expert at Sorry!
taylor_swift	And keeping lines blurry
taylor_swift	Never impressed
taylor_swift	By me acing your tests
taylor_swift	All the girls that you run dry
taylor_swift	Have tired lifeless eyes
taylor_swift	'Cause you burned them out
taylor_swift	But I took your matches
taylor_swift	Before fire could catch me
taylor_swift	So don't look now
taylor_swift	I'm shining like fireworks
taylor_swift	Over your sad, empty town
taylor_swift	Dear John
taylor_swift	I see it all now that you're gone
taylor_swift	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
taylor_swift	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
taylor_swift	I see it all now that you're gone
taylor_swift	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
taylor_swift	The girl in the dress wrote you a song
taylor_swift	You should've known
taylor_swift	You should've known
taylor_swift	Don't you think I was too young?
taylor_swift	You should've known
taylor_swift	She walks to school with her arms crossed
taylor_swift	It's just another day
taylor_swift	At 10 o'clock she hears the screaming
taylor_swift	Then finally she sees them
taylor_swift	It's scary how things change
taylor_swift	And I saw the story on the news
taylor_swift	I saw the footage from the roof
taylor_swift	I sat down and cried
taylor_swift	Didn't she call you
taylor_swift	Didn't she need you bad enough?
taylor_swift	Was there some reason
taylor_swift	Another way up?
taylor_swift	Did you not write it down
taylor_swift	Just one more thing to do
taylor_swift	Where were you
taylor_swift	And didn't she pray too?
taylor_swift	He kissed his wife goodbye
taylor_swift	And took the earliest flight
taylor_swift	So he could be home that night
taylor_swift	To put his kids to sleep
taylor_swift	Down the aisle
taylor_swift	Three men walked and said
taylor_swift	"We're here to die for our God"
taylor_swift	He stood up and said, "That's funny
taylor_swift	'Cause my God died for me"
taylor_swift	I put the magazine down
taylor_swift	I read his words out loud
taylor_swift	I sat down and cried
taylor_swift	Didn't he call you
taylor_swift	Didn't he need you bad enough?
taylor_swift	Was there some reason
taylor_swift	Another way up?
taylor_swift	Did you not write it down
taylor_swift	Just one more thing to do
taylor_swift	Where were you
taylor_swift	And didn't he pray too?
taylor_swift	The taxis were full up
taylor_swift	On the very day of
taylor_swift	The rope 100 floors up
taylor_swift	Just to come back down
taylor_swift	They never thought they'd see the day
taylor_swift	The, the tower'd be up in flames
taylor_swift	There was nothing left to say
taylor_swift	When it all came down
taylor_swift	And didn't they call you
taylor_swift	Didn't they need you bad enough?
taylor_swift	Was there some reason
taylor_swift	Another way up?
taylor_swift	Did you not write it down
taylor_swift	Just one more thing to do
taylor_swift	Where were you?
taylor_swift	Where were you?
taylor_swift	And didn't they pray, oh
taylor_swift	I walk to school and I wear a cross
taylor_swift	I'm counting every day
taylor_swift	You say you want to wait to get married,
taylor_swift	Why you in a pause,
taylor_swift	You say it's not your time yet,
taylor_swift	When is the perfect time for you
taylor_swift	Just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
taylor_swift	Tell me you found someone else in your life
taylor_swift	Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
taylor_swift	But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore
taylor_swift	What changed your mind in two days
taylor_swift	Did I do something wrong to make you put a hold
taylor_swift	On our future,
taylor_swift	It was just a week ago when you asked me
taylor_swift	What date I plan to ask you the big question,
taylor_swift	Why did you do this to me
taylor_swift	Just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
taylor_swift	Tell me you found someone else in your life
taylor_swift	Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
taylor_swift	But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore
taylor_swift	It was perfectly set how it would go down
taylor_swift	All our dream would have come real
taylor_swift	Now you put them in a coffin and put the dirt on them
taylor_swift	Should just add a stone to them and make it read
taylor_swift	Here lies the dreams of a fallen futures,
taylor_swift	Just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
taylor_swift	Tell me you found someone else in your life
taylor_swift	Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
taylor_swift	But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore
taylor_swift	Why did yo do this 
taylor_swift	Now I stand here with this ring, flowers, and dirt on my knees
taylor_swift	Tears falling down my eyes with humiliation,
taylor_swift	It might as well just rain and have lightning strike and miss me,
taylor_swift	Tonight isnt a lucky night,
taylor_swift	Now I can't look you in the eyes any more,
taylor_swift	Just go ahead and walk away
taylor_swift	Just leave me here in my misery of shame,
taylor_swift	Just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
taylor_swift	Tell me you found someone else in your life
taylor_swift	Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
taylor_swift	don't say you're sorry
taylor_swift	And don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore
taylor_swift	You say you want to wait to get married
taylor_swift	You say you're not ready yet
taylor_swift	You say today isnt good enough for you
taylor_swift	Do me a favor and do put me on hold,
taylor_swift	Because I don't want to anymore
taylor_swift	Now that he's back in the atmosphere
taylor_swift	With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
taylor_swift	He acts like summer and walks like rain
taylor_swift	Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
taylor_swift	Since his return from the stay on the moon
taylor_swift	He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey
taylor_swift	Tell me did you sail across the sun
taylor_swift	Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
taylor_swift	And that heaven is overrated
taylor_swift	Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
taylor_swift	One without a permanent scar
taylor_swift	And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there
taylor_swift	Now that he's back from that soul vacation
taylor_swift	Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
taylor_swift	He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
taylor_swift	Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey
taylor_swift	Now that he's back in the atmosphere
taylor_swift	I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
taylor_swift	Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
taylor_swift	Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
taylor_swift	Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
taylor_swift	And head back to the Milky Way
taylor_swift	And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
taylor_swift	Was it everything you wanted to find
taylor_swift	And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
taylor_swift	Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
taylor_swift	Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
taylor_swift	Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation
taylor_swift	The best soy latte that you ever had in May
taylor_swift	Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
taylor_swift	Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
taylor_swift	And head back to the Milky Way
taylor_swift	And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
taylor_swift	One without a permanent scar
taylor_swift	And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
taylor_swift	Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
taylor_swift	Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
taylor_swift	Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
taylor_swift	Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
taylor_swift	Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation
taylor_swift	The best soy latte that you ever had in May
taylor_swift	There I was again tonight
taylor_swift	Forcing laughter, faking smiles
taylor_swift	Same old tired, lonely place
taylor_swift	Walls of insincerity
taylor_swift	Shifting eyes and vacancy
taylor_swift	Vanished when I saw your face
taylor_swift	All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
taylor_swift	Your eyes whispered, have we met?
taylor_swift	Cross the room your silhouette
taylor_swift	Starts to make its way to me
taylor_swift	The playful conversation starts
taylor_swift	Counter all your quick remarks
taylor_swift	Like passing notes in secrecy
taylor_swift	And it was enchanting to meet you
taylor_swift	All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
taylor_swift	This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
taylor_swift	I'm wonderstruck, blushing on the way home
taylor_swift	I'll spend forever wondering if you know
taylor_swift	I was enchanted to meet you
taylor_swift	The lingering question kept me up
taylor_swift	Two a.m., who do you love?
taylor_swift	I wonder till I'm wide awake
taylor_swift	And now I'm pacing back and forth
taylor_swift	Wishing you were at my door
taylor_swift	I'd open up and you would say
taylor_swift	Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
taylor_swift	All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
taylor_swift	This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
taylor_swift	I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
taylor_swift	I'll spend forever wondering if you know
taylor_swift	This night is flawless, don't you let it go
taylor_swift	I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
taylor_swift	I'll spend forever wondering if you know
taylor_swift	I was enchanted to meet you
taylor_swift	This is me praying that
taylor_swift	This was the very first page
taylor_swift	Not where the storyline ends
taylor_swift	My thoughts will echo your name
taylor_swift	Until I see you again
taylor_swift	These are the words I held back
taylor_swift	As I was leaning to say
taylor_swift	I was enchanted to meet you
taylor_swift	Please don't be in love with someone else
taylor_swift	Please don't have somebody waiting on you
taylor_swift	Please don't be in love with someone else
taylor_swift	Please don't have somebody waiting on you
taylor_swift	This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
taylor_swift	I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
taylor_swift	I'll spend forever wondering if you know
taylor_swift	This night is flawless, don't you let it go
taylor_swift	I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
taylor_swift	I'll spend forever wondering if you know
taylor_swift	I was enchanted to meet you
taylor_swift	Please don't be in love with someone else
taylor_swift	Please don't have somebody waiting on you

taylor_swift	Everybody's waiting
taylor_swift	Everybody's watching
taylor_swift	Even when you're sleeping
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	The tricky thing
taylor_swift	Is yesterday we were just children
taylor_swift	Playing soldiers, just pretending
taylor_swift	Dreaming dreams with happy endings
taylor_swift	In backyards
taylor_swift	Winning battles with our wooden swords
taylor_swift	But now we've stepped into a cruel world
taylor_swift	Where everybody stands and keeps score
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Everybody's waiting for you to break down
taylor_swift	Everybody's watching to see the fallout
taylor_swift	Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	So here you are
taylor_swift	Two steps ahead and staying on guard
taylor_swift	Every lesson forms a new scar
taylor_swift	They never thought you'd make it this far
taylor_swift	But turn around
taylor_swift	Oh, they've surrounded you with a showdown
taylor_swift	And nobody comes to save you now
taylor_swift	But you got something they don't, yeah, you got something they don't
taylor_swift	You just gotta keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Everybody's waiting for you to break down
taylor_swift	Everybody's watching to see the fallout
taylor_swift	Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes
taylor_swift	Keep your feet ready
taylor_swift	Heartbeat steady
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your aim locked
taylor_swift	The night grows dark
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Everybody's waiting for you to break down
taylor_swift	Everybody's watching to see the fallout

taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Keep your eyes open
taylor_swift	Isn't it funny how many times we can say,
taylor_swift	We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
taylor_swift	And moved on
taylor_swift	That's what we thought
taylor_swift	But here I am in the same old car, 
taylor_swift	Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
taylor_swift	Uh oh, uh oh,
taylor_swift	I won't tell nobody
taylor_swift	I won't tell my friends
taylor_swift	We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
taylor_swift	And  we'll tell each other things like I need you
taylor_swift	You and me
taylor_swift	Baby this is what we do
taylor_swift	I may see
taylor_swift	There are people you just come back to
taylor_swift	So fall back on me
taylor_swift	Fall back on you
taylor_swift	You always let someone come in between
taylor_swift	Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
taylor_swift	Look at all this wasted time
taylor_swift	I won't tell nobody
taylor_swift	I won't tell my friend
taylor_swift	We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
taylor_swift	And we'll tell each other things, like I love you
taylor_swift	You and me
taylor_swift	Baby this is what we do
taylor_swift	I may see
taylor_swift	There are people who you come back to
taylor_swift	So fall back on me, 
taylor_swift	Fall back on you
taylor_swift	Maybe we'll last
taylor_swift	Maybe we won't
taylor_swift	Maybe we'll stop talking and *?* like girls
taylor_swift	But just, baby, get along with me
taylor_swift	You and me
taylor_swift	Baby this is what we do
taylor_swift	I may see
taylor_swift	There are people that you come back too

taylor_swift	Fall back on me baby,
taylor_swift	Baby I'll fall back on you
taylor_swift	Fall back on you
taylor_swift	Fall back on you
taylor_swift	You say you've turned it off
taylor_swift	Hid your heart up on a shelf
taylor_swift	Scared of what it might cost
taylor_swift	To take it off for someone else
taylor_swift	'Cause lovin him you lost
taylor_swift	Too much of yourself
taylor_swift	Baby can't you see that he's not me and...
taylor_swift	I need you to know you can fall into me
taylor_swift	That my arms are wide open
taylor_swift	And will always be
taylor_swift	Right here waiting, staying strong
taylor_swift	Come and fall into me
taylor_swift	I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you
taylor_swift	I'll open up my soul
taylor_swift	If that's what you need me to do
taylor_swift	But now baby it's your move
taylor_swift	All you've got to do
taylor_swift	Is believe in love, just believe in us now...
taylor_swift	I need you to know you can fall into me

taylor_swift	And will always be
taylor_swift	Right here waiting, staying strong
taylor_swift	Come and fall into me

taylor_swift	Just believe in us
taylor_swift	Baby....
taylor_swift	I need you to know you can fall into me

taylor_swift	And will always be
taylor_swift	Right here waiting, staying strong
taylor_swift	Come and fall into me
taylor_swift	Come and fall into me
taylor_swift	Baby fall into me
taylor_swift	There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
taylor_swift	There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
taylor_swift	And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
taylor_swift	In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
taylor_swift	We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
taylor_swift	I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
taylor_swift	But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
taylor_swift	Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
taylor_swift	And I don't know how it gets better than this
taylor_swift	You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
taylor_swift	And I don't know why but with you I dance
taylor_swift	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
taylor_swift	So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
taylor_swift	In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
taylor_swift	In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
taylor_swift	In this moment, now capture it, remember it
taylor_swift	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
taylor_swift	You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
taylor_swift	And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
taylor_swift	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
taylor_swift	Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
taylor_swift	My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
taylor_swift	But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
taylor_swift	It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
taylor_swift	It's fearless
taylor_swift	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
taylor_swift	You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
taylor_swift	And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
taylor_swift	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
taylor_swift	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
taylor_swift	You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
taylor_swift	And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
taylor_swift	In a storm in my best dress, fearless
taylor_swift	You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
taylor_swift	It's the mornin' of your very first day
taylor_swift	You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
taylor_swift	Try and stay out of everybody's way
taylor_swift	It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
taylor_swift	For the next four years in this town
taylor_swift	Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
taylor_swift	You know I haven't seen you around, before
taylor_swift	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
taylor_swift	And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
taylor_swift	Well count to ten, take it in
taylor_swift	This is life before you know who you're gonna be, fifteen
taylor_swift	You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
taylor_swift	And soon enough you're best friends
taylor_swift	Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
taylor_swift	We'll be outta here as soon as we can
taylor_swift	And then you're on your very first date
taylor_swift	And he's got a car, and you're feelin' like flyin'
taylor_swift	And your Mama's waitin' up, and you're thinkin' he's the one
taylor_swift	And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends, when the night ends
taylor_swift	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
taylor_swift	And when you're fifteen and your first kiss, makes your head spin round
taylor_swift	But, in your life you'll do things greater than, datin' the boy on the football team
taylor_swift	But I didn't know it at fifteen
taylor_swift	When all you wanted, was to be wanted
taylor_swift	Wish you could go back, and tell yourself what you know now
taylor_swift	Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
taylor_swift	But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
taylor_swift	And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind 
taylor_swift	And we both cried
taylor_swift	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
taylor_swift	And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
taylor_swift	I've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be
taylor_swift	I didn't know who I was supposed to be, at fifteen
taylor_swift	La-la-la la-la-la la la la la
taylor_swift	La-la-la la-la-la la la la la
taylor_swift	La-la-la la-la-la
taylor_swift	Your very first day
taylor_swift	Take a deep breath girl
taylor_swift	Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
taylor_swift	Someone struck a match against the night,
taylor_swift	All I could see was you and I.
taylor_swift	I was captivated.
taylor_swift	A perfect little dream inside my head,
taylor_swift	And then reality crept in, and erased it.
taylor_swift	For a while I thought that I could hold you,
taylor_swift	But you were just a temporary high.
taylor_swift	Firefly you drew me to you,
taylor_swift	Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
taylor_swift	And you don't know it, do you?
taylor_swift	I wish I could keep you, firefly
taylor_swift	Firefly
taylor_swift	Something so beautiful and free,
taylor_swift	Was as never meant to be caged in
taylor_swift	I thought I had you in my hand,
taylor_swift	I tried to catch you, but I can't
taylor_swift	Chase the wind
taylor_swift	And just as I reach out to touch you,
taylor_swift	I remind myself you were meant to fly.
taylor_swift	Firefly you drew me to you,
taylor_swift	Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
taylor_swift	And you don't know it, do you?
taylor_swift	I wish I could keep you firefly
taylor_swift	Firefly
taylor_swift	I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
taylor_swift	Not even that is enough
taylor_swift	Firefly you drew me to you
taylor_swift	Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
taylor_swift	And you don't know it do you?
taylor_swift	I wish I could keep you
taylor_swift	I wish I could keep you, firefly
taylor_swift	Firefly
taylor_swift	Once upon a time
taylor_swift	I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
taylor_swift	We caught onto something
taylor_swift	I hold onto the night
taylor_swift	You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
taylor_swift	Were you just kidding?
taylor_swift	'Cause it seems to me
taylor_swift	This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
taylor_swift	I don't feel welcome anymore
taylor_swift	Baby what happened, please tell me
taylor_swift	'Cause one second it was perfect
taylor_swift	Now you're halfway out the door
taylor_swift	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
taylor_swift	And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
taylor_swift	And you flashback to when he said forever and always
taylor_swift	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
taylor_swift	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
taylor_swift	'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
taylor_swift	Was I out of line?
taylor_swift	Did I say something way too honest
taylor_swift	Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
taylor_swift	I looked into your eyes
taylor_swift	Thought I knew you for a minute
taylor_swift	Now I'm not so sure
taylor_swift	So here's to everything 
taylor_swift	Coming down to nothing
taylor_swift	Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
taylor_swift	Where is this going? 
taylor_swift	Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
taylor_swift	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
taylor_swift	And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
taylor_swift	And you flashback to when he said forever and always
taylor_swift	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
taylor_swift	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
taylor_swift	'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
taylor_swift	You didn't mean it, baby
taylor_swift	I don't think so, ohh
taylor_swift	Oh, back up, baby, back up
taylor_swift	Did you forget everything?
taylor_swift	Back up, baby, back up
taylor_swift	Did you forget everything?
taylor_swift	'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
taylor_swift	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
taylor_swift	'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
taylor_swift	Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
taylor_swift	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
taylor_swift	And you flashback to when we said forever and always
taylor_swift	And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
taylor_swift	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
taylor_swift	'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
taylor_swift	You didn't mean it, baby
taylor_swift	You said forever and always, yeah
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that
taylor_swift	I don't even know her, but I feel a responsibility
taylor_swift	To do what's upstanding and right
taylor_swift	It's kinda like a code, yeah, and you've been getting closer and closer
taylor_swift	And crossing so many lines
taylor_swift	And it would be a fine proposition
taylor_swift	If I was a stupid girl
taylor_swift	But, honey, I am no one's exception
taylor_swift	This I have previously learned
taylor_swift	So don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	And I see you turn off your phone
taylor_swift	And now you've got me alone
taylor_swift	And I say
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	I just wanna make sure, you understand perfectly
taylor_swift	You're the kind of man who makes me sad
taylor_swift	While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
taylor_swift	And take for granted what you have
taylor_swift	And it would be a fine proposition
taylor_swift	If I was a stupid girl
taylor_swift	And, yeah, I might go with it
taylor_swift	If I hadn't once been just like her
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	I see you turn off your phone
taylor_swift	And now you've got me alone
taylor_swift	And I say
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	Call a cab, lose my number
taylor_swift	You're about to lose your girl
taylor_swift	Call a cab, lose my number
taylor_swift	Let's consider this lesson learned
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	Wanna see you pick up your phone
taylor_swift	And tell her you're coming home
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
taylor_swift	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
taylor_swift	It would be a fine proposition
taylor_swift	If I hadn't once been just like her
taylor_swift	You and I walk a fragile line
taylor_swift	I have known it all this time
taylor_swift	But I never thought I'd live to see it break
taylor_swift	It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
taylor_swift	And I can't trust anything now
taylor_swift	And It's coming over you  like it's all a big mistake
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm holding my breath
taylor_swift	Won't see you again
taylor_swift	Something's made your eyes go cold
taylor_swift	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
taylor_swift	I thought I had you figured out
taylor_swift	Something's gone terribly wrong
taylor_swift	You're all I wanted
taylor_swift	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
taylor_swift	I thought I had you figured out
taylor_swift	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
taylor_swift	Can't turn back, now I'm haunted
taylor_swift	Stood there, watched you walk away
taylor_swift	From everything we had
taylor_swift	But I still mean every word I said to you
taylor_swift	He will try to take away my pain
taylor_swift	And he just might make me smile
taylor_swift	But the whole time 
taylor_swift	I'm wishing he was you instead
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm holding my breath
taylor_swift	Won't see you again
taylor_swift	Something keeps me holding on to nothing
taylor_swift	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
taylor_swift	I thought I had you figured out
taylor_swift	Something's gone terribly wrong
taylor_swift	You're all I wanted
taylor_swift	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
taylor_swift	I thought I had you figured out
taylor_swift	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
taylor_swift	Can't turn back, now I'm haunted
taylor_swift	I know
taylor_swift	I know
taylor_swift	I just know
taylor_swift	You're not gone
taylor_swift	You can't be gone
taylor_swift	No
taylor_swift	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
taylor_swift	I thought I had you figured out
taylor_swift	Something's gone terribly wrong
taylor_swift	You're all I wanted
taylor_swift	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
taylor_swift	I thought I had you figured out
taylor_swift	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
taylor_swift	Can't turn back, now I'm haunted
taylor_swift	Oh
taylor_swift	You and I walk a fragile line
taylor_swift	I have known it all this time
taylor_swift	Though I never thought I'd see it break
taylor_swift	Never thought I'd see it
taylor_swift	Here you come again
taylor_swift	Just when I'm about to get myself together
taylor_swift	You waltz right through the door
taylor_swift	Just like you've done before
taylor_swift	And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
taylor_swift	Here you come again
taylor_swift	Just when I'm about to make it work without you
taylor_swift	You look into my eyes, and light those dreamy eyes
taylor_swift	And pretty soon I'm wonderin'
taylor_swift	How I came to doubt you
taylor_swift	All you gotta do
taylor_swift	Is smile that smile, and there go all my defenses
taylor_swift	Just leave it up to you, and in a little while
taylor_swift	You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
taylor_swift	Here you come again
taylor_swift	Lookin' better than a body has the right to
taylor_swift	And shakin' me up so
taylor_swift	That all I really know
taylor_swift	Is here you come again
taylor_swift	All you gotta do
taylor_swift	Is smile that smile, and there go all my defenses
taylor_swift	Just leave it up to you, and in a little while
taylor_swift	You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
taylor_swift	Here you come again
taylor_swift	Lookin' better than a body has the right to
taylor_swift	And shakin' me up so that all I really know
taylor_swift	Is here you come again
taylor_swift	And here I go
taylor_swift	And here you come again
taylor_swift	And here I go, oh, oh
taylor_swift	And here I go
taylor_swift	And here you come again
taylor_swift	And here I go, oh, no
taylor_swift	And here I go
taylor_swift	Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
taylor_swift	But I know I saw a light in you
taylor_swift	And as we walked, we were talking
taylor_swift	I didn't say half the things I wanted to
taylor_swift	Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
taylor_swift	I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
taylor_swift	Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
taylor_swift	I don't always have to be alone
taylor_swift	'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
taylor_swift	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
taylor_swift	So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
taylor_swift	Can't help it if there's no one else
taylor_swift	Mmm, I can't help myself
taylor_swift	Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
taylor_swift	So I got some things to say to you
taylor_swift	I've seen it all so I thought that
taylor_swift	I'd never see nobody shine the way you do
taylor_swift	The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
taylor_swift	It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
taylor_swift	Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving? 
taylor_swift	I think you and I should stay the same
taylor_swift	'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
taylor_swift	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
taylor_swift	So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
taylor_swift	Can't help it if there's no one else
taylor_swift	Mmm, I can't help myself
taylor_swift	They're dimming the street lights
taylor_swift	You're perfect for me 
taylor_swift	Why aren't you here tonight
taylor_swift	I'm waiting alone now
taylor_swift	So come on and come out
taylor_swift	And pull me near
taylor_swift	Shine, shine, shine
taylor_swift	Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
taylor_swift	Why I should be the one you choose
taylor_swift	All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
taylor_swift	But would they write a song for you?
taylor_swift	I can't help it if you look like an angel
taylor_swift	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
taylor_swift	So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
taylor_swift	Can't help it if there's no one else
taylor_swift	Mmm, I can't help myself
taylor_swift	If you look like an angel
taylor_swift	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
taylor_swift	So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
taylor_swift	Can't help it if there's no one else
taylor_swift	Mmm, I can't help myself
taylor_swift	Myself
taylor_swift	Can't help myself
taylor_swift	I can't help myself
taylor_swift	I was reminiscing just the other day
taylor_swift	While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
taylor_swift	Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
taylor_swift	Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
taylor_swift	Took off faster than a green light, go
taylor_swift	Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
taylor_swift	I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
taylor_swift	And that was the first day
taylor_swift	And, darling, it was good
taylor_swift	Never looking down
taylor_swift	And right there where we stood
taylor_swift	Was holy ground
taylor_swift	Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
taylor_swift	We had this big wide city all to ourselves
taylor_swift	We blocked the noise with the sound of "I need you."
taylor_swift	And for the first time I had something to lose
taylor_swift	And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
taylor_swift	And the storys got dust on every page
taylor_swift	Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
taylor_swift	And I see your face in every crowd
taylor_swift	'Cause, darling, it was good
taylor_swift	Never looking down
taylor_swift	And right there where we stood
taylor_swift	Was holy ground
taylor_swift	Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
taylor_swift	But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
taylor_swift	Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
taylor_swift	But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
taylor_swift	It was good
taylor_swift	Never looking down
taylor_swift	And right there where we stood
taylor_swift	Was holy ground
taylor_swift	Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
taylor_swift	But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
taylor_swift	Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
taylor_swift	But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
taylor_swift	I think of you every single evening 
taylor_swift	As I lay awake at night.
taylor_swift	I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
taylor_swift	And I say:
taylor_swift	Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
taylor_swift	Say that everything will be fine!
taylor_swift	Oh, honey baby, oh,
taylor_swift	How can you blame me,
taylor_swift	When I say I wanna make you mine?
taylor_swift	Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy, 
taylor_swift	Except you, honey baby!
taylor_swift	Oh!
taylor_swift	Flying high, I can see his smiling, 
taylor_swift	As we walk down by the drives.
taylor_swift	Take my hand, take my breath away,
taylor_swift	Cause you make me feel like flying!
taylor_swift	Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
taylor_swift	Say that everything will be fine!
taylor_swift	Oh, honey baby, oh,
taylor_swift	How can you blame me,
taylor_swift	When I say I wanna make you mine?
taylor_swift	Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy, 
taylor_swift	Except you, honey baby!
taylor_swift	Oh!
taylor_swift	Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
taylor_swift	Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
taylor_swift	Drive me crazy, have me baby,
taylor_swift	All I really wanna say is:
taylor_swift	Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
taylor_swift	Say that everything will be fine!
taylor_swift	Oh, honey baby, oh,
taylor_swift	How can you blame me,
taylor_swift	When I say I wanna make you mine?
taylor_swift	Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy, 
taylor_swift	Oh, except you, honey baby!
taylor_swift	Guess mine is not the first heart broken,
taylor_swift	My eyes are not the first to cry I'm not the first to know,
taylor_swift	There's just no gettin' over you
taylor_swift	Hello, I'm just a fool who's willing to sit around
taylor_swift	And wait for you
taylor_swift	But baby can't you see, there's nothin' else
taylor_swift	For me to do I'm hopelessly devoted to you
taylor_swift	But now there's nowhere to hide,
taylor_swift	Since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head,
taylor_swift	Hopelessly devoted to you
taylor_swift	Hopelessly devoted to you,
taylor_swift	Hopelessly devoted to you
taylor_swift	My head is saying "fool, forget him",
taylor_swift	My heart is saying "don't let go"
taylor_swift	Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
taylor_swift	I'm hopelessly devoted to you
taylor_swift	But now there's nowhere to hide,
taylor_swift	Since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head,
taylor_swift	Hopelessly devoted to you
taylor_swift	Hopelessly devoted to you,
taylor_swift	Hopelessly devoted to you
taylor_swift	Stand there like a ghost
taylor_swift	Shaking from the rain, rain
taylor_swift	She'll open up the door
taylor_swift	And say "Are you insane?"
taylor_swift	Say it's been a long six months
taylor_swift	And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl
taylor_swift	And then you say
taylor_swift	I want you for worse or for better
taylor_swift	I would weep for ever and ever
taylor_swift	Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
taylor_swift	I would weep for ever and ever
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl, girl
taylor_swift	Remind her how it
taylor_swift	Used to be, be, yeah, yeah
taylor_swift	With pictures in frames
taylor_swift	Of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
taylor_swift	Tell her how you must've lost your mind, ooh
taylor_swift	When you left her all alone and never told her why, why
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	That's how you lost the girl
taylor_swift	And now you say
taylor_swift	I want you for worse or for better
taylor_swift	I would weep for ever and ever
taylor_swift	Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
taylor_swift	I would weep for ever and ever
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl, girl, yeah yeah
taylor_swift	And you could know
taylor_swift	That I don't want you to go
taylor_swift	Remind me how it used to be
taylor_swift	Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
taylor_swift	And say you want me, yeah, yeah
taylor_swift	And then you say
taylor_swift	I want you for worse or for better
taylor_swift	I would weep for ever and ever
taylor_swift	Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
taylor_swift	I would weep for ever and ever
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl, girl
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl, girl
taylor_swift	(Get the girl)
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl, girl
taylor_swift	And that's how it works
taylor_swift	It's how you get the girl, girl
taylor_swift	That's how it works
taylor_swift	That's how you got the girl
taylor_swift	I don't think that passenger seat,
taylor_swift	Has ever looked this good to me
taylor_swift	He tells me about his night,
taylor_swift	An' I count the colors in his eyes
taylor_swift	He'll never fall in love,
taylor_swift	He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair
taylor_swift	I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
taylor_swift	And I don't think it ever crossed his mind,
taylor_swift	He tells a joke, I fake a smile
taylor_swift	But, I know all his favorite songs
taylor_swift	And I could tell you:
taylor_swift	His favorite color's green,
taylor_swift	He loves to argue,
taylor_swift	Born on the seventeenth,
taylor_swift	His sister's beautiful,
taylor_swift	He has his father's eyes,
taylor_swift	And if you ask me if I love him,
taylor_swift	I'd lie
taylor_swift	He looks around the room,
taylor_swift	Innocently overlooks the truth
taylor_swift	Shouldn't a light go on?
taylor_swift	Doesn't he know that I've had it memorized for so long
taylor_swift	He sees everything in black and white
taylor_swift	Never let nobody see him cry
taylor_swift	An' I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine
taylor_swift	I could tell you:
taylor_swift	His favorite color's green,
taylor_swift	He loves to argue,
taylor_swift	Born on the seventeenth,
taylor_swift	His sister's beautiful,
taylor_swift	He has his father's eyes,
taylor_swift	And if you ask me if I love him,
taylor_swift	I'd lie
taylor_swift	He stands there, 
taylor_swift	Then walks away
taylor_swift	My God, if I could only say,
taylor_swift	I'm holding every breath for you
taylor_swift	He'd never tell you, 
taylor_swift	But he can play guitar
taylor_swift	I think he can see through,
taylor_swift	evrything but my heart
taylor_swift	First thought when I wake up is:
taylor_swift	My God, he's beautiful
taylor_swift	So, I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle
taylor_swift	Yes, I could tell you:
taylor_swift	His favorite color's green,
taylor_swift	He loves to argue,
taylor_swift	Oh, and it kills me,
taylor_swift	His sister's beautiful,
taylor_swift	He has his father's eyes,
taylor_swift	And if you ask me if I love him,
taylor_swift	If you ask me if I love him,
taylor_swift	I'd lie
taylor_swift	Friday night beneath the stars
taylor_swift	In a field behind your yard
taylor_swift	You and I are painting pictures in the sky
taylor_swift	And sometimes we don't say a thing
taylor_swift	Just listen to the crickets sing
taylor_swift	Everything I need is right here by my side
taylor_swift	And I know everything about you
taylor_swift	I don't wanna live without you
taylor_swift	I'm only up when you're not down
taylor_swift	Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
taylor_swift	It's like no matter what I do
taylor_swift	Well, you drive me crazy half the time
taylor_swift	The other half I'm only trying
taylor_swift	To let you know that what I feel is true
taylor_swift	And I'm only me when I'm with you
taylor_swift	Just a small town boy and girl
taylor_swift	Livin' in a crazy world
taylor_swift	Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
taylor_swift	And I don't try to hide my tears
taylor_swift	The secrets all my deepest fears
taylor_swift	Through it all nobody gets me like you do
taylor_swift	And you know everything about me
taylor_swift	You say that you can't live without me
taylor_swift	I'm only up when you're not down
taylor_swift	Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
taylor_swift	It's like no matter what I do
taylor_swift	Well, you drive me crazy half the time
taylor_swift	The other half I'm only trying
taylor_swift	To let you know that what I feel is true
taylor_swift	And I'm only me when I'm with you
taylor_swift	When I'm with anybody else
taylor_swift	It's so hard to be myself
taylor_swift	Only you can see
taylor_swift	I'm only up when you're not down
taylor_swift	Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
taylor_swift	It's like no matter what I do
taylor_swift	Well, you drive me crazy half the time
taylor_swift	The other half I'm only trying
taylor_swift	To let you know that what I feel is true
taylor_swift	And I'm only me, who I wanna be
taylor_swift	Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
taylor_swift	With you
taylor_swift	I bet this time of night, youre still up
taylor_swift	I bet youre tired from a long, hard week
taylor_swift	I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window, lookin' out at the city
taylor_swift	And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
taylor_swift	And I just wanna tell you
taylor_swift	It takes everything in me not to call you
taylor_swift	And I wish I could run to you
taylor_swift	And I hope you know that
taylor_swift	Every time I dont
taylor_swift	I almost do, I almost do
taylor_swift	I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
taylor_swift	Cause each time you reach out, theres no reply
taylor_swift	I bet it never, ever occurred to you
taylor_swift	That I cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye
taylor_swift	And I just wanna tell you
taylor_swift	It takes everything in me not to call you
taylor_swift	And I wish I could run to you
taylor_swift	And I hope you know that
taylor_swift	Every time I dont
taylor_swift	I almost do, I almost do
taylor_swift	Whoa, we made quite a mess, babe
taylor_swift	Its probably better off this way
taylor_swift	And I confess, baby
taylor_swift	In my dreams youre touching my face
taylor_swift	And askin' me if I wanna try again with you
taylor_swift	And I almost do
taylor_swift	And I just wanna tell you
taylor_swift	It takes everything in me not to call you
taylor_swift	And I wish I could run to you
taylor_swift	And I hope you know that
taylor_swift	Every time I dont
taylor_swift	I almost do, I almost do
taylor_swift	I bet this time of night youre still up
taylor_swift	I bet youre tired from a long, hard week
taylor_swift	I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window looking out at the city
taylor_swift	And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
taylor_swift	Wish I had concentrated,
taylor_swift	They said love was complicated,
taylor_swift	But it's something I just fell into
taylor_swift	And it was over-rated,
taylor_swift	But just look what I created,
taylor_swift	I came out alive but i'm black and blue
taylor_swift	But boy you ask me if I'm all right
taylor_swift	Think about what I had to do, yeah
taylor_swift	Wake up, smell the break-up
taylor_swift	Fix my heart put on my make-up
taylor_swift	Another mess I didn't plan
taylor_swift	And I bet you thought you beat me
taylor_swift	Wish you could only see
taylor_swift	I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand
taylor_swift	I'd be fine if you just walked by,
taylor_swift	But you had to talk about why 
taylor_swift	You were wrong and I was right
taylor_swift	But I can't believe you made me
taylor_swift	Sit at home, cry like a baby 
taylor_swift	Wait right by the phone every night
taylor_swift	And now you ask about you and I
taylor_swift	There's no you and I
taylor_swift	Remember what you put me through
taylor_swift	I had to
taylor_swift	Wake up, smell the break-up
taylor_swift	Fix my heart put on my make-up
taylor_swift	Another mess I didn't plan
taylor_swift	And I bet you thought you beat me
taylor_swift	Wish you could only see
taylor_swift	I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand
taylor_swift	And when you're home all alone at night
taylor_swift	You still wonder why
taylor_swift	You took everything i had away but
taylor_swift	I haven't thought about you and I
taylor_swift	There's no you and I
taylor_swift	And I know someday you will
taylor_swift	Wake up, smell the break-up
taylor_swift	Realize that we won't make up
taylor_swift	It didn't go the way you planned
taylor_swift	And you'll know you didn't beat me
taylor_swift	When you look down and see
taylor_swift	I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand
taylor_swift	Written on the back of my hand
taylor_swift	An "I heart question mark" yeah written on the back of my hand
taylor_swift	Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
taylor_swift	I was in your sights, you got me alone
taylor_swift	You found me, you bound me, you bound me
taylor_swift	I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
taylor_swift	And when I fell hard, you took a step back
taylor_swift	Without me, without me, without me
taylor_swift	And he's long gone when he's next to me
taylor_swift	And I realize the blame is on me
taylor_swift	'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
taylor_swift	So shame on me now
taylor_swift	Flew me to places I'd never been
taylor_swift	Till you put me down
taylor_swift	Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
taylor_swift	So shame on me now
taylor_swift	Flew me to places I'd never been
taylor_swift	Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
taylor_swift	No apologies, he'll never see you cry
taylor_swift	Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
taylor_swift	You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
taylor_swift	Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
taylor_swift	A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
taylor_swift	And now I see, now I see, now I see
taylor_swift	He was long gone when he met me
taylor_swift	And I realise the joke is on me, hey
taylor_swift	I knew you were trouble when you walked in
taylor_swift	So shame on me now
taylor_swift	Flew me to places I'd never been
taylor_swift	Till you put me down
taylor_swift	Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
taylor_swift	So shame on me now
taylor_swift	Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
taylor_swift	Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
taylor_swift	And the saddest fear comes creeping in
taylor_swift	That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
taylor_swift	I knew you were trouble when you walked in
taylor_swift	So shame on me now
taylor_swift	Flew me to places I'd never been
taylor_swift	Till you put me down
taylor_swift	Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in (You were right there)
taylor_swift	So shame on me now (You were right there)
taylor_swift	Flew me to places I'd never been(Oh)
taylor_swift	Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
taylor_swift	I knew you were trouble when you walked in
taylor_swift	Trouble, trouble, trouble
taylor_swift	I knew you were trouble when you walked in
taylor_swift	Trouble, trouble, trouble
taylor_swift	(I, I, I, I) I
taylor_swift	(I, I, I, I) I
taylor_swift	You stand with your hand on my waistline
taylor_swift	It's a scene and we're out in plain sight
taylor_swift	I can hear them whisper as they pass by
taylor_swift	It's a bad sign, bad sign
taylor_swift	Something happens when everybody finds out
taylor_swift	See the vulture circling dark clouds
taylor_swift	Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
taylor_swift	It could burn out
taylor_swift	'Cause they got the cages
taylor_swift	They got the boxes and guns
taylor_swift	They are the hunters
taylor_swift	We are the foxes and we run
taylor_swift	Baby
taylor_swift	I know places we won't be found
taylor_swift	And they'll be
taylor_swift	Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
taylor_swift	'Cause I, I know places
taylor_swift	We can hide, I know places
taylor_swift	I know places
taylor_swift	Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
taylor_swift	Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
taylor_swift	Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
taylor_swift	Not this time
taylor_swift	Just grab my hand
taylor_swift	And don't ever drop it, my love
taylor_swift	They are the hunters
taylor_swift	We are the foxes and we run
taylor_swift	Baby
taylor_swift	I know places we won't be found
taylor_swift	And they'll be
taylor_swift	Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
taylor_swift	'Cause I, I know places
taylor_swift	We can hide, I know places
taylor_swift	They are the hunters
taylor_swift	We are the foxes and we run
taylor_swift	Just grab my hand
taylor_swift	And don't ever drop it, my love
taylor_swift	Baby
taylor_swift	I know places we won't be found
taylor_swift	And they'll be
taylor_swift	Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
taylor_swift	'Cause I, I know places
taylor_swift	We can hide, I know places
taylor_swift	They take their shots, we're bulletproof
taylor_swift	(I know places)
taylor_swift	And you know for me it's always you
taylor_swift	(I know places)
taylor_swift	And you're dead at night, your eyes so grey
taylor_swift	(I know places)
taylor_swift	And I know for you it's always me
taylor_swift	(I know places)
taylor_swift	(I, I, I, I) I
taylor_swift	(I, I, I, I) I
taylor_swift	{Taylor}
taylor_swift	I'm all alone and it's too dark
taylor_swift	I need a man on my mark
taylor_swift	In times like these I still need a guy
taylor_swift	Nick you are so mine
taylor_swift	Hey, Nick I know it's dark but I need you
taylor_swift	I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
taylor_swift	I don't how I can be without you

taylor_swift	Back in your heart
taylor_swift	Oh darling I was blind to let you go
taylor_swift	(Let you go baby)
taylor_swift	Now that I see you in her arms
taylor_swift	It's 2:00 AM, in your car
taylor_swift	Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
taylor_swift	You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
taylor_swift	You're thinking that I hate you now
taylor_swift	'Cause you still don't know what I never said
taylor_swift	I wish you would come back
taylor_swift	Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
taylor_swift	I wish you knew that
taylor_swift	I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
taylor_swift	And I wish you were right here, right now
taylor_swift	It's all good, I wish you would
taylor_swift	It's 2:00 AM, in my room
taylor_swift	Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
taylor_swift	We're a crooked love in a straight line down
taylor_swift	Makes you wanna run and hide
taylor_swift	Bet it makes you turn right back around
taylor_swift	I wish you would come back
taylor_swift	Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
taylor_swift	I wish you knew that
taylor_swift	I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
taylor_swift	And I wish you were right here, right now
taylor_swift	It's all good, I wish you would
taylor_swift	I wish we could go back
taylor_swift	And remember what we were fighting for
taylor_swift	And I wish you knew that
taylor_swift	I miss you too much to be mad anymore
taylor_swift	And I wish you were right here, right now
taylor_swift	It's all good, I wish you would
taylor_swift	I, I, I, I, I, I
taylor_swift	I wish, I wish, I
taylor_swift	I, I, I, I, I, I
taylor_swift	I wish, I wish, I
taylor_swift	I, I, I, I, I, I
taylor_swift	I wish, I wish, I
taylor_swift	I, I, I, I, I, I
taylor_swift	I wish, I wish, I
taylor_swift	You always knew how to push my buttons
taylor_swift	You give me everything or nothing
taylor_swift	This mad, mad love makes you come running
taylor_swift	Stand back where you stood
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	(I wish you would, I wish you would)
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	(I wish you would, I wish you would)
taylor_swift	I wish, I wish, I
taylor_swift	2am, here we are
taylor_swift	See your face, hear my voice in the dark
taylor_swift	We're a crooked love in a straight line down
taylor_swift	Makes you wanna run and hide
taylor_swift	But it made us turn right back around
taylor_swift	I wish you would come back
taylor_swift	Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
taylor_swift	I wish you knew that
taylor_swift	I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
taylor_swift	And I wish you were right here, right now
taylor_swift	It's all good, I wish you would
taylor_swift	I wish you would come back
taylor_swift	Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
taylor_swift	I wish you knew that
taylor_swift	I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
taylor_swift	And I wish you were right here, right now
taylor_swift	It's all good, I wish you would
taylor_swift	I wish we could go back
taylor_swift	And remember what we were fighting for
taylor_swift	And I wish you knew that
taylor_swift	I miss you too much to be mad anymore
taylor_swift	And I wish you were right here, right now
taylor_swift	It's all good, I wish you would
taylor_swift	You always knew how to push my buttons
taylor_swift	You give me everything or nothing
taylor_swift	This mad, mad love makes you come running
taylor_swift	Stand back where you stood
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	(I wish you would, I wish you would)
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	(I wish you would, I wish you would)
taylor_swift	(I wish you would, I wish you would)
taylor_swift	I, I, I, I, I, I
taylor_swift	I wish, I wish, I
taylor_swift	I, I, I, I, I, I
taylor_swift	I wish, I wish, I
taylor_swift	I wish you would
taylor_swift	Throwing pennies at the fountain
taylor_swift	But when you're standing on the mountain
taylor_swift	It's kinda hard to aim
taylor_swift	Like the tree we cut our names in,
taylor_swift	There must be an explanation 
taylor_swift	Guess it didn't get enough rain
taylor_swift	I need reasons why you're leaving
taylor_swift	When I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star
taylor_swift	I guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
taylor_swift	Cause I swore when you said that you loved me,
taylor_swift	Guess I heard you wrong
taylor_swift	And I guess I wished on a plane, and I thought it was a star
taylor_swift	Last night I heard my own heart beating
taylor_swift	Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
taylor_swift	Six months gone and I'm still reaching
taylor_swift	Even though I know you're not there
taylor_swift	I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
taylor_swift	Thinking about everything we've been through
taylor_swift	Maybe I've been going back too much lately
taylor_swift	When time stood still and I had you
taylor_swift	Come back, come back, come back to me like
taylor_swift	You would, you would if this was a movie
taylor_swift	Standing in the rain outside until I came out
taylor_swift	Come back, come back, come back to me like
taylor_swift	You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
taylor_swift	I know that we could work it out somehow
taylor_swift	But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
taylor_swift	I know people change and these things happen
taylor_swift	But I remember how it was back then
taylor_swift	Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
taylor_swift	Because nothing like this ever happened to them
taylor_swift	Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
taylor_swift	Flashback to the night when you said to me
taylor_swift	That nothing's going to change, not for me and you
taylor_swift	That before I knew how much I had to lose
taylor_swift	Come back, come back, come back to me like
taylor_swift	You would, you would if this was a movie
taylor_swift	Standing in the rain outside until I came out
taylor_swift	Come back, come back, come back to me like
taylor_swift	You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
taylor_swift	I know that we could work it out somehow
taylor_swift	But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
taylor_swift	If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
taylor_swift	I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
taylor_swift	I just want it back the way it was before
taylor_swift	And I just want to see you back at my front door
taylor_swift	And I'd say
taylor_swift	Come back, come back, come back to me like
taylor_swift	You would before you said it's not that easy
taylor_swift	Before the fight, before I let you walk
taylor_swift	But I take it all back now
taylor_swift	Come back, come back, come back to me like
taylor_swift	You would, you would if this was a movie
taylor_swift	Standing in the rain outside until I came out
taylor_swift	Come back, come back, come back to me like
taylor_swift	You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
taylor_swift	I know that we could work it out somehow
taylor_swift	But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
taylor_swift	You'd be here by now
taylor_swift	It's not the kind of ending you'd want to see now
taylor_swift	Baby, what about the ending
taylor_swift	I thought you'd be here by now
taylor_swift	Thought you'd be here by now
taylor_swift	The way you love is like a full on rainstorm
taylor_swift	And I'm a house of cards
taylor_swift	You're the kind of reckless that you send me runnin
taylor_swift	But I kind of know that I won't get far
taylor_swift	And you stood there in front of me just
taylor_swift	Close enough to touch
taylor_swift	Close enough to hope you couldn't see
taylor_swift	What I was thinking of
taylor_swift	Drop everything now
taylor_swift	Meet me in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	Kiss me on the sidewalk
taylor_swift	Take away the pain
taylor_swift	Cause' I see sparks fly
taylor_swift	Whenever you Smile
taylor_swift	Get me with those green eyes, baby
taylor_swift	As the lights go down
taylor_swift	Gimme something little hot
taylor_swift	For when you'r not around
taylor_swift	Cause' I see sparks fly
taylor_swift	Whenever you Smile
taylor_swift	My mind forgets to advise me
taylor_swift	You're a bad idea
taylor_swift	You touch me once and
taylor_swift	It's really something
taylor_swift	You find I'm even better
taylor_swift	Than you imagined I would be
taylor_swift	I'm on my guard with the rest of the world
taylor_swift	But with you I know it's no good
taylor_swift	And I could wait patiently but I 
taylor_swift	I really wish you would
taylor_swift	Drop everything now
taylor_swift	Meet me in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	Kiss me on the sidewalk 
taylor_swift	Take away the pain
taylor_swift	Cause' I see sparks fly
taylor_swift	Whenever you smile
taylor_swift	Get me with those green eyes baby
taylor_swift	As the lights go down
taylor_swift	Gimme something little hot
taylor_swift	For when you're not around
taylor_swift	Cause' I see sparks fly
taylor_swift	Whenever you Smile
taylor_swift	I run my fingers through your hair
taylor_swift	And watch the lights go wild
taylor_swift	Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
taylor_swift	It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
taylor_swift	And lead me up the staircase slowly
taylor_swift	And whisper something slow
taylor_swift	???????
taylor_swift	Like a firework show
taylor_swift	Drop everything now
taylor_swift	Meet me in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	Kiss me on the sidewalk 
taylor_swift	Take away the pain
taylor_swift	Cause' I see sparks fly
taylor_swift	Whenever you smile
taylor_swift	Get me with those green eyes baby
taylor_swift	As the lights go down
taylor_swift	Gimme something little hot
taylor_swift	For when you're not around
taylor_swift	Cause I see sparks fly 
taylor_swift	Whenever you
taylor_swift	Smile
taylor_swift	And the sparks fly
taylor_swift	Yeah baby smile
taylor_swift	And the sparks fly
taylor_swift	Yeah
taylor_swift	I guess you really did it this time
taylor_swift	Left yourself in your warpath
taylor_swift	Lost your balance on a tightrope
taylor_swift	Lost your mind trying to get it back
taylor_swift	Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
taylor_swift	Always a bigger bed to crawl into
taylor_swift	Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
taylor_swift	And everybody believed in you?
taylor_swift	It's all right, just wait and see
taylor_swift	Your string of lights is still bright to me
taylor_swift	Oh, who you are is not where you've been
taylor_swift	You're still an innocent
taylor_swift	You're still an innocent
taylor_swift	Did some things you can't speak of
taylor_swift	But at night you live it all again
taylor_swift	You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
taylor_swift	If only you'd seen what you know now then
taylor_swift	Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
taylor_swift	And everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
taylor_swift	Wasn't it beautiful, running wild till you fell asleep
taylor_swift	Before the monsters caught up to you?
taylor_swift	It's all right, just wait and see
taylor_swift	Your string of lights is still bright to me
taylor_swift	Oh, who you are is not where you've been
taylor_swift	You're still an innocent
taylor_swift	It's okay, life is a tough crowd
taylor_swift	Thirty two and still growing up now
taylor_swift	Who you are is not what you did
taylor_swift	You're still an innocent
taylor_swift	Time turns flames to embers
taylor_swift	You'll have new Septembers
taylor_swift	Every one of us has messed up, too
taylor_swift	Lives change like the weather
taylor_swift	I hope you remember
taylor_swift	Today is never too late to be brand new
taylor_swift	It's all right, just wait and see
taylor_swift	Your string of lights is still bright to me
taylor_swift	Oh, who you are is not where you've been
taylor_swift	You're still an innocent
taylor_swift	It's okay, life is a tough crowd
taylor_swift	Thirty two and still growing up now
taylor_swift	Who you are is not what you did
taylor_swift	You're still an innocent
taylor_swift	You're still an innocent
taylor_swift	Lost your balance on the tightrope
taylor_swift	It's never too late to get back
taylor_swift	She can't see the way your eyes
taylor_swift	Light up when you smile
taylor_swift	She'll never notice how you stop and stare
taylor_swift	Whenever she walks by
taylor_swift	And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
taylor_swift	But you are everything to me
taylor_swift	And I just wanna show you
taylor_swift	She don't even know you
taylor_swift	She's never gonna love you
taylor_swift	Like I want to
taylor_swift	You just see right through me
taylor_swift	But if you only knew me
taylor_swift	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
taylor_swift	Instead of just invisible
taylor_swift	There's a fire inside of you
taylor_swift	That cant help but shine through
taylor_swift	She's never gonna see the light
taylor_swift	No matter what you do
taylor_swift	And all I think about is how to make you think of me
taylor_swift	And everything that we could be
taylor_swift	I just wanna show you
taylor_swift	She don't even know you
taylor_swift	She's never gonna love you
taylor_swift	Like I want to
taylor_swift	And you just see right through me
taylor_swift	But if you only knew me
taylor_swift	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
taylor_swift	Instead of just invisible
taylor_swift	Like shadows in a faded light
taylor_swift	Oh, were invisible
taylor_swift	I just wanna look in your eyes
taylor_swift	And make you realise
taylor_swift	I just wanna show you
taylor_swift	She don't even know you
taylor_swift	Baby, let me love you
taylor_swift	Let me want you
taylor_swift	You just see right through me
taylor_swift	But if you only knew me
taylor_swift	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
taylor_swift	Instead of just invisible
taylor_swift	She can't see the way your eyes
taylor_swift	Light up when you smile
taylor_swift	(Spoken):
taylor_swift	We can step it up just a little bit of a notch. We can step it up I think. And I want you to sing along. To every song that I sing that you know please. As loud as you possibly can. I will not get offended. I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this.

taylor_swift	Say that you wanna be with me too
taylor_swift	'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
taylor_swift	So jump then fall
taylor_swift	The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
taylor_swift	I'll catch you, I'll catch you
taylor_swift	When people say things that bring you to your knees
taylor_swift	I'll catch you
taylor_swift	The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
taylor_swift	But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
taylor_swift	Whoa, I need you baby
taylor_swift	Don't be afraid, please jump then fall, jump then fall into me
taylor_swift	Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
taylor_swift	Say that you wanna be with me too
taylor_swift	'Cause I'ma stay through it all 
taylor_swift	So jump then fall
taylor_swift	Jump then fall, baby

taylor_swift	And every time you shine, I'll shine
taylor_swift	And every time you're here, baby
taylor_swift	I'll show you, I'll show you you can
taylor_swift	Jump then fall, jump then fall
taylor_swift	Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah
taylor_swift	She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
taylor_swift	She didn't have a reason to stay
taylor_swift	Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun,
taylor_swift	She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
taylor_swift	And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
taylor_swift	But I understand it somehow
taylor_swift	If I could drive all night 
taylor_swift	Would I find my peace of mind
taylor_swift	Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
taylor_swift	An unfamiliar exit sign
taylor_swift	If I just drive on by, 
taylor_swift	Just south of knowing why
taylor_swift	I didn't really know her that well, 
taylor_swift	But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind. 
taylor_swift	She felt so out of touch, just felt too much
taylor_swift	If you don't know what you want, nothings ever enough
taylor_swift	And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
taylor_swift	Thats where I'm headed right now
taylor_swift	If I could drive all night 
taylor_swift	Would I find my peace of mind
taylor_swift	Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
taylor_swift	An unfamiliar exit sign
taylor_swift	If I just drive on by, 
taylor_swift	Just south of knowing why
taylor_swift	I don't have a plan
taylor_swift	I don't have a map
taylor_swift	I don't even know if I'm ever going back
taylor_swift	I don't have a when
taylor_swift	And I don't have a where
taylor_swift	I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm there
taylor_swift	And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
taylor_swift	But I understand it somehow
taylor_swift	But If I could drive all night 
taylor_swift	Would I find my peace of mind
taylor_swift	Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
taylor_swift	An unfamiliar exit sign
taylor_swift	If I just drive on by, 
taylor_swift	Just south of knowing why
taylor_swift	I just drive on by
taylor_swift	Drive on
taylor_swift	Drive on
taylor_swift	Drive all night
taylor_swift	If I drive on
taylor_swift	Drive on
taylor_swift	Drive on
taylor_swift	Drive all night
taylor_swift	Just south of knowing why
taylor_swift	Last Christmas I gave you my heart
taylor_swift	But the very next day you gave it away
taylor_swift	This year, to save me from tears,
taylor_swift	I'll give it to someone special
taylor_swift	Once bitten and twice shy
taylor_swift	I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
taylor_swift	Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
taylor_swift	Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
taylor_swift	"Merry Christmas" - I wrapped it up and sent it
taylor_swift	With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
taylor_swift	Now I know what a fool I've been
taylor_swift	But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
taylor_swift	Last Christmas I gave you my heart
taylor_swift	But the very next day you gave it away
taylor_swift	This year, to save me from tears,
taylor_swift	I'll give it to someone special
taylor_swift	Last Christmas I gave you my heart
taylor_swift	But the very next day you gave it away
taylor_swift	This year, to save me from tears,
taylor_swift	I'll give it to someone special
taylor_swift	A crowded room, and friends with tired eyes
taylor_swift	I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
taylor_swift	My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
taylor_swift	Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
taylor_swift	A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
taylor_swift	A girl under cover but you tore her apart
taylor_swift	Maybe this year, maybe this year
taylor_swift	I'll give it to someone special
taylor_swift	Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
taylor_swift	But the very next day you gave it away
taylor_swift	This year, to save me from tears,
taylor_swift	I'll give it to someone special
taylor_swift	Last Christmas I gave you my heart
taylor_swift	But the very next day you gave it away
taylor_swift	This year, to save me from tears,
taylor_swift	I'll give it to someone special
taylor_swift	And last Christmas
taylor_swift	And this year
taylor_swift	It won't be anything like, anything like
taylor_swift	Last Christmas I gave you my heart
taylor_swift	But the very next day you gave it away
taylor_swift	This year, to save me from tears,
taylor_swift	I'll give it to someone special
taylor_swift	I still remember the look on your face
taylor_swift	Lit through the darkness at one fifty-eight
taylor_swift	The words that you whispered, for just us to know
taylor_swift	You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
taylor_swift	If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
taylor_swift	Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
taylor_swift	That July ninth, the beat of your heart
taylor_swift	It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
taylor_swift	But now I'll go
taylor_swift	Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
taylor_swift	All that I know is
taylor_swift	I don't know how to be something you miss
taylor_swift	I never thought we'd have our last kiss
taylor_swift	Never imagined we'd end like this
taylor_swift	Your name, forever the name on my lips
taylor_swift	I do remember the swing in your step
taylor_swift	The life of the party, you're showing off again
taylor_swift	And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
taylor_swift	I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did
taylor_swift	Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
taylor_swift	I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
taylor_swift	How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
taylor_swift	There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
taylor_swift	And now I'll go
taylor_swift	Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
taylor_swift	All that I know is
taylor_swift	I don't know how to be something you miss
taylor_swift	I never thought we'd have our last kiss
taylor_swift	Never imagined we'd end like this
taylor_swift	Your name, forever the name on my lips
taylor_swift	So I'll watch your life in pictures
taylor_swift	Like I used to watch you sleep
taylor_swift	And I feel you forget me
taylor_swift	Like I used to feel you breathe
taylor_swift	And I'll keep up with our old friends
taylor_swift	Just to ask them how you are
taylor_swift	Hope it's nice where you are
taylor_swift	And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
taylor_swift	And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
taylor_swift	You can plan for a change in the weather and time
taylor_swift	But I never planned on you changing your mind
taylor_swift	So I'll go
taylor_swift	Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
taylor_swift	All that I know is
taylor_swift	I don't know how to be something you miss
taylor_swift	I never thought we'd have our last kiss
taylor_swift	Never imagined we'd end like this
taylor_swift	Your name, forever the name on my lips
taylor_swift	Just like our last kiss
taylor_swift	Forever the name on my lips
taylor_swift	Forever the name on my lips
taylor_swift	Just like our last
taylor_swift	You see me giving people weird looks, I cant help it is ma face,
taylor_swift	My kind is the odd and quiet type, but I can be loud when I want to,
taylor_swift	Dont be a racist idiot, you hate the nazis too,
taylor_swift	You're just a fat guy who needs a life, but I'm not helping that task
taylor_swift	You tell all your friends that I am real strange,
taylor_swift	You cant talk cos your gay,
taylor_swift	Fat gay, fat lad, fat man, hanging on the wall,
taylor_swift	You need give me space, ortherwise I will.... Nut you.
taylor_swift	You call me a phyco, you dont know what your saying,
taylor_swift	You call me every name under the starlit sky, 
taylor_swift	Get a life, thats worth living, your making mine like hell.
taylor_swift	Dont be gay, oops wait, your bi-sexual,
taylor_swift	Dont be stupid and wreck your life,
taylor_swift	Go away DJ, I aint that phyco, who nutted that lad under the old bridge,
taylor_swift	Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone!
taylor_swift	One day break, one heart ache, every once upon a time
taylor_swift	That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines
taylor_swift	They mean so much to everyone, 
taylor_swift	But you count them up one by one
taylor_swift	Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
taylor_swift	A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
taylor_swift	Your black boots, my red flower ring
taylor_swift	They're for the little things
taylor_swift	Oil paintings and make it, every details turned out bad
taylor_swift	One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person
taylor_swift	It means so much to everyone
taylor_swift	But you count them up one by one
taylor_swift	Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
taylor_swift	A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
taylor_swift	Your black boots, my red flower ring
taylor_swift	They're for the little things, oho, yeah, 
taylor_swift	No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
taylor_swift	Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right
taylor_swift	Strawberries and fairies with wings
taylor_swift	They're for the little things, 
taylor_swift	Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah
taylor_swift	Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah.
taylor_swift	I said, "Remember this moment"
taylor_swift	In the back of my mind
taylor_swift	The time we stood with our shaking hands
taylor_swift	The crowds in stands went wild
taylor_swift	We were the kings and the queens
taylor_swift	And they read off our names
taylor_swift	The night you danced like you knew
taylor_swift	Our lives would never be the same
taylor_swift	You held your head like a hero
taylor_swift	On a history book page
taylor_swift	It was the end of a decade
taylor_swift	But the start of an age
taylor_swift	Long live
taylor_swift	The walls we crashed through
taylor_swift	All the kingdom lights shined
taylor_swift	Just for me and you
taylor_swift	I was screaming, long live
taylor_swift	All the magic we made
taylor_swift	And bring on all the pretenders
taylor_swift	One day
taylor_swift	We will be remembered
taylor_swift	I said, "Remember this feeling?"
taylor_swift	I passed the pictures around
taylor_swift	Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
taylor_swift	Wishing for right now
taylor_swift	We are the kings and the queens
taylor_swift	You traded your baseball cap for a crown
taylor_swift	When they gave us our trophies
taylor_swift	And we held them up for our town
taylor_swift	And the cynics were outraged
taylor_swift	Screaming, "This is absurd!"
taylor_swift	'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
taylor_swift	Got to rule the world
taylor_swift	Long live
taylor_swift	The walls we crashed through
taylor_swift	All the kingdom lights shined
taylor_swift	Just for me and you
taylor_swift	I was screaming, long live
taylor_swift	All the magic we made
taylor_swift	And bring on all the pretenders
taylor_swift	I'm not afraid
taylor_swift	Long live
taylor_swift	All the mountains we moved
taylor_swift	I had the time of my life
taylor_swift	Fighting dragons with you
taylor_swift	I was screaming, long live
taylor_swift	That look on your face
taylor_swift	And bring on all the pretenders
taylor_swift	One day
taylor_swift	We will be remembered
taylor_swift	Hold on to spinning around
taylor_swift	Confetti falls to the ground
taylor_swift	May these memories break our fall
taylor_swift	Can you take a moment
taylor_swift	Promise me this
taylor_swift	That you'll stand by me forever
taylor_swift	But if, God forbid, fate should step in
taylor_swift	And force us into a goodbye
taylor_swift	If you have children some day
taylor_swift	When they point to the pictures
taylor_swift	Please tell them my name
taylor_swift	Tell them how the crowds went wild
taylor_swift	Tell them how I hope they shine
taylor_swift	Long live 
taylor_swift	The walls we crashed through
taylor_swift	I had the time of my life
taylor_swift	With you
taylor_swift	Long, long live
taylor_swift	The walls we crashed through
taylor_swift	All the kingdom lights shined
taylor_swift	Just for me and you
taylor_swift	And I was screaming, long live
taylor_swift	All the magic we made
taylor_swift	And bring on all the pretenders
taylor_swift	I'm not afraid
taylor_swift	Singing, long live
taylor_swift	All the mountains we moved
taylor_swift	I had the time of my life
taylor_swift	Fighting dragons with you
taylor_swift	And long, long live
taylor_swift	That look on your face
taylor_swift	And bring on all the pretenders
taylor_swift	One day
taylor_swift	We will be remembered
taylor_swift	We were both young when I first saw you
taylor_swift	I close my eyes and the flashback starts
taylor_swift	I'm standing there
taylor_swift	On the balcony in summer air
taylor_swift	See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
taylor_swift	See you make your way through the crowd
taylor_swift	And say, "Hello."
taylor_swift	Little did I know
taylor_swift	That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
taylor_swift	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
taylor_swift	And I was crying on the staircase
taylor_swift	Begging you, "Please don't go!" 
taylor_swift	And I said
taylor_swift	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
taylor_swift	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
taylor_swift	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
taylor_swift	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."
taylor_swift	So I sneak out to the garden to see you
taylor_swift	We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
taylor_swift	So close your eyes
taylor_swift	Escape this town for a little while
taylor_swift	Oh, oh
taylor_swift	'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
taylor_swift	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
taylor_swift	But you were everything to me
taylor_swift	I was begging you, "Please don't go!" 
taylor_swift	And I said
taylor_swift	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
taylor_swift	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
taylor_swift	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
taylor_swift	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."
taylor_swift	Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
taylor_swift	This love is difficult, but it's real
taylor_swift	Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
taylor_swift	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."
taylor_swift	Oh, oh
taylor_swift	I got tired of waiting
taylor_swift	Wondering if you were ever coming around
taylor_swift	My faith in you was fading
taylor_swift	When I met you on the outskirts of town 
taylor_swift	And I said
taylor_swift	Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
taylor_swift	I keep waiting for you but you never come
taylor_swift	Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
taylor_swift	He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
taylor_swift	Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
taylor_swift	I love you, and that's all I really know
taylor_swift	I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
taylor_swift	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."
taylor_swift	Oh, oh
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, oh
taylor_swift	'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
taylor_swift	There's a little girl in this little town
taylor_swift	with a little too much heart to go around
taylor_swift	Live forever, never say never
taylor_swift	You can do better, that's what she says
taylor_swift	Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
taylor_swift	A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances and smiles
taylor_swift	The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
taylor_swift	And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
taylor_swift	do do do do do do do do
taylor_swift	Lucky you, lucky you
taylor_swift	Do do do do do do do do
taylor_swift	She sings her little songs
taylor_swift	She walks a long a little
taylor_swift	Halfway headed for the skies
taylor_swift	Left to travel, lives they unravel
taylor_swift	Mind over matter, that's what she says
taylor_swift	Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
taylor_swift	A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances and smiles
taylor_swift	The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
taylor_swift	And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do
taylor_swift	do do do do do do do do do do do
taylor_swift	Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
taylor_swift	do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
taylor_swift	Maybe she'll sing you do do do
taylor_swift	Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
taylor_swift	Honey, she'll love you
taylor_swift	Funny how some view angels above you, ain't so far away.
taylor_swift	Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
taylor_swift	A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances and smiles
taylor_swift	The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
taylor_swift	And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do
taylor_swift	do do do do do do do do do do
taylor_swift	Your feet under the table
taylor_swift	 I love it when theyre touching mine
taylor_swift	 Your hands make the? cradle
taylor_swift	 To tell me everything is fine
taylor_swift	 All I see is you looking at me
taylor_swift	Do you know when you go
taylor_swift	 You make the sweetest sight at the window
taylor_swift	 If you had never come out of the blue
taylor_swift	 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
taylor_swift	You smile just like a picture
taylor_swift	 It doesnt even need a frame
taylor_swift	 Sometimes I wait to answer
taylor_swift	 Just to hear you say my name
taylor_swift	 And all I want is just what ive got
taylor_swift	Do you know when you go 
taylor_swift	You make the sweetest sight at the window
taylor_swift	 If you had never come out of the blue
taylor_swift	 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
taylor_swift	Id never let you go
taylor_swift	 Even If I could
taylor_swift	 Cause I never couldve dreamed you up this good
taylor_swift	Oh oh
taylor_swift	Do you know when you go
taylor_swift	 You make the sweetest sight at the window
taylor_swift	 If you had never come out of the blue
taylor_swift	 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
taylor_swift	Made Up You
taylor_swift	Oh oh
taylor_swift	Made Up You
taylor_swift	She said "I was seven and you were nine
taylor_swift	I looked at you like the stars that shine
taylor_swift	In the sky
taylor_swift	The pretty lights
taylor_swift	And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
taylor_swift	Growing up and falling in love
taylor_swift	And our mamas smiled
taylor_swift	And rolled their eyes
taylor_swift	And said "Oh, my, my, my"
taylor_swift	Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
taylor_swift	Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
taylor_swift	You never did
taylor_swift	You never did
taylor_swift	Took me back when the world was one block wide
taylor_swift	I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
taylor_swift	Just two kids
taylor_swift	You and I
taylor_swift	Oh, my, my, my
taylor_swift	Well I was sixteen when suddenly
taylor_swift	I wasn't that little girl you used to see
taylor_swift	But your eyes still shined
taylor_swift	Like pretty lights
taylor_swift	And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
taylor_swift	They never believed we'd really fall in love
taylor_swift	And our mamas smiled
taylor_swift	And rolled their eyes,
taylor_swift	And said "Oh, my, my, my"
taylor_swift	Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
taylor_swift	Two A.M. running in your truck
taylor_swift	And all I need is you next to me
taylor_swift	Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
taylor_swift	Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
taylor_swift	You stayed outside
taylor_swift	'Till the morning light
taylor_swift	Oh, my, my, my
taylor_swift	A few years have gone and come around
taylor_swift	We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
taylor_swift	And you looked at me
taylor_swift	Got down on one knee
taylor_swift	Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
taylor_swift	Our whole town came
taylor_swift	And our mamas cried
taylor_swift	You said "I do"
taylor_swift	And I did too
taylor_swift	Take me home where we met so many years before
taylor_swift	We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
taylor_swift	After all this time
taylor_swift	You and I
taylor_swift	I'll be eighty seven
taylor_swift	You'll be eighty nine
taylor_swift	I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
taylor_swift	In the sky
taylor_swift	Oh, my, my, my
taylor_swift	I shined your shoes
taylor_swift	I poured the wine
taylor_swift	I gave you all of my time
taylor_swift	I patched your fake smile
taylor_swift	Against your friends
taylor_swift	Which apparently is a crime
taylor_swift	I gave you space
taylor_swift	You took my place
taylor_swift	And gave it to her
taylor_swift	But life's too long 
taylor_swift	To waste it all loving a liar
taylor_swift	And when love hands me matches now
taylor_swift	I'm gonna burn it down
taylor_swift	I keyed her car
taylor_swift	Got my guitar
taylor_swift	And wrote this damn song
taylor_swift	Look what you've found
taylor_swift	She's been around
taylor_swift	I hear the lines long
taylor_swift	And don't you tell me 
taylor_swift	To be nice
taylor_swift	I'm not a nice girl
taylor_swift	She died from complications
taylor_swift	Of the things you told her
taylor_swift	So when love hands me matches now
taylor_swift	I'm gonna burn it down
taylor_swift	Ain't it funny
taylor_swift	You said honey
taylor_swift	You meant sitting duck
taylor_swift	Well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
taylor_swift	Just a few I've thought of
taylor_swift	And when love hands me matches now
taylor_swift	'Gonna burn it down
taylor_swift	I'm gonna burn it down
taylor_swift	Oh yeah
taylor_swift	Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down
taylor_swift	Matches, now
taylor_swift	I am moving through the crowd
taylor_swift	Trying to find myself
taylor_swift	Feel like a guitar that's never played
taylor_swift	Will someone strum away?
taylor_swift	And I ask myself
taylor_swift	Who do I wanna be?
taylor_swift	Do I wanna throw away the key?
taylor_swift	And invent a whole new me
taylor_swift	And I tell myself
taylor_swift	No One, No One
taylor_swift	Don't wanna be
taylor_swift	No One
taylor_swift	But me..
taylor_swift	You are moving through the crowd
taylor_swift	Trying to find yourself
taylor_swift	Feelin' like a doll left on a shelf
taylor_swift	Will someone take you down?
taylor_swift	And you ask yourself
taylor_swift	Who do I wanna be?
taylor_swift	Do I wanna throw away the key?
taylor_swift	And invent a whole new me
taylor_swift	Gotta tell yourself
taylor_swift	No One, No One
taylor_swift	Don't wanna be
taylor_swift	No One
taylor_swift	But me..
taylor_swift	Your life plays out on the shadows of the wall
taylor_swift	You turn the light on to erase it all
taylor_swift	You wonder what it's like to not feel worthless
taylor_swift	So open all the blinds and all the curtains
taylor_swift	No One, No One
taylor_swift	Don't wanna be
taylor_swift	No One
taylor_swift	But me..
taylor_swift	We are moving through the crowd...
taylor_swift	You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
taylor_swift	You have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like I'm nothing
taylor_swift	You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard, calling me out when I'm wounded
taylor_swift	You, pickin' on the weaker man
taylor_swift	You can take me down 
taylor_swift	With just one single blow
taylor_swift	But you don't know what you don't know
taylor_swift	Someday I'll be living in a big old city
taylor_swift	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
taylor_swift	Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
taylor_swift	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
taylor_swift	Why you gotta be so mean?
taylor_swift	You, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliation
taylor_swift	You, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them
taylor_swift	I'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
taylor_swift	I just wanna feel okay again
taylor_swift	I'll bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
taylor_swift	But the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road
taylor_swift	And you don't know what you don't know
taylor_swift	Someday I'll be living in a big old city
taylor_swift	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
taylor_swift	Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
taylor_swift	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
taylor_swift	Why you gotta be so mean?
taylor_swift	And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game
taylor_swift	With that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening
taylor_swift	Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
taylor_swift	Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
taylor_swift	But all you are is mean
taylor_swift	All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
taylor_swift	And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
taylor_swift	But someday I'll be living in a big old city
taylor_swift	And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
taylor_swift	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
taylor_swift	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
taylor_swift	Why you gotta be so mean?
taylor_swift	Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
taylor_swift	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
taylor_swift	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
taylor_swift	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
taylor_swift	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
taylor_swift	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
taylor_swift	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
taylor_swift	Why you gotta be so mean?
taylor_swift	You were in college working part-time waiting tables
taylor_swift	Left a small town, never looked back
taylor_swift	I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
taylor_swift	Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
taylor_swift	I say, "Can you believe it?"
taylor_swift	As we're lying on the couch
taylor_swift	The moment I can see it
taylor_swift	Yes, yes
taylor_swift	I can see it now
taylor_swift	Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
taylor_swift	You put your arm around me for the first time
taylor_swift	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
taylor_swift	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
taylor_swift	Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
taylor_swift	And there's a drawer of my things at your place
taylor_swift	You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
taylor_swift	You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
taylor_swift	But we got bills to pay
taylor_swift	We got nothing figured out
taylor_swift	When it was hard to take
taylor_swift	Yes, yes
taylor_swift	This is what I thought about
taylor_swift	Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
taylor_swift	You put your arm around me for the first time
taylor_swift	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
taylor_swift	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
taylor_swift	Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
taylor_swift	You saw me start to believe for the first time
taylor_swift	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
taylor_swift	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
taylor_swift	And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
taylor_swift	As everything was slipping right out of our hands
taylor_swift	I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
taylor_swift	Braced myself for the goodbye
taylor_swift	'Cause that's all I've ever known
taylor_swift	Then you took me by surprise
taylor_swift	You said I'll never leave you alone
taylor_swift	You said
taylor_swift	I remember how we felt sitting by the water
taylor_swift	And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
taylor_swift	I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
taylor_swift	She is the best thing that's ever been mine
taylor_swift	Hold on
taylor_swift	Make it last
taylor_swift	Hold on
taylor_swift	Never turn back
taylor_swift	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
taylor_swift	You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)
taylor_swift	(Oh yeah)
taylor_swift	Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
taylor_swift	Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
taylor_swift	Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
taylor_swift	I can see it now
taylor_swift	You were in college working part time waiting tables
taylor_swift	Left a small town, never looked back
taylor_swift	I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
taylor_swift	Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
taylor_swift	I say can you believe it?
taylor_swift	As we're lying on the couch
taylor_swift	The moment I could see it
taylor_swift	Yes, yes, I can see it now
taylor_swift	Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
taylor_swift	You put your arm around me for the first time
taylor_swift	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

taylor_swift	Taylor (spoken):
taylor_swift	Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton
taylor_swift	Um, I met him a couple months ago
taylor_swift	Doing a show out in California
taylor_swift	Um and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said "Ya know I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music" and I read that and I'm like wow thats really cool so I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows.And so, ya know, I asked him to come out and sing with me.And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kinda silent but the crowd was like "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that? 
taylor_swift	Crowd: 
taylor_swift	Woo!!
taylor_swift	Taylor (Spoken):
taylor_swift	Thats what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up "Do you wanna be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks. And uh he goes "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kinda my point and asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video.Have yall seen that one? Would yall like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So uh, the song I asked to sing with him um a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. Ya see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley.So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So uh, Tyler ya gonna sing a song with me?
taylor_swift	Tyler (spoken): 
taylor_swift	Yeah
taylor_swift	Lets do it!
taylor_swift	If ya guys know, sing along too.
taylor_swift	Taylor:

taylor_swift	Read letters that I wrote on the wall
taylor_swift	And the message I left on my car
taylor_swift	Need you now
taylor_swift	Word I said drowned out by the rain
taylor_swift	Waiting there for you but you never came
taylor_swift	My world's a little colder now
taylor_swift	But I'm keeping warm somehow
taylor_swift	So here you are at my window
taylor_swift	Guess nobody told you
taylor_swift	I don't need you, don't need you
taylor_swift	And I waited so frustrated
taylor_swift	Who's gonna hold you
taylor_swift	I don't need you, don't need you
taylor_swift	Now
taylor_swift	Need you now
taylor_swift	Words I heard you whisper to me
taylor_swift	We were walking down a one way street
taylor_swift	You need me now 
taylor_swift	That's what you've been telling my friends
taylor_swift	But I've come too far to go back there again
taylor_swift	My heart and my number has changed
taylor_swift	You might as well forget my name
taylor_swift	So here you are at my window
taylor_swift	Guess nobody told you
taylor_swift	I don't need you don't need you
taylor_swift	And I waited so frustrated
taylor_swift	So who's gonna hold you
taylor_swift	I don't need you don't need you now
taylor_swift	And i'm not what you want
taylor_swift	I won't wonder where you are
taylor_swift	I won't dream a thousand stars
taylor_swift	I don't need you now
taylor_swift	I don't need you by the rain
taylor_swift	And i never heard you say
taylor_swift	I need you, i need you
taylor_swift	I don't need you now
taylor_swift	Don't need you
taylor_swift	I don't need you now
taylor_swift	Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
taylor_swift	And it's so quiet in the world tonight
taylor_swift	Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
taylor_swift	So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
taylor_swift	To you everything's funny
taylor_swift	You've got nothing to regret
taylor_swift	I'd give all I have, honey
taylor_swift	If you could stay like that
taylor_swift	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Just stay this little
taylor_swift	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	It could stay this simple
taylor_swift	I won't let nobody hurt you
taylor_swift	Won't let no one break your heart
taylor_swift	No, no one will desert you
taylor_swift	Just try to never grow up
taylor_swift	Never grow up
taylor_swift	You're in the car on the way to the movies
taylor_swift	And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
taylor_swift	At fourteen there is just so much you can't do
taylor_swift	And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
taylor_swift	But don't make her drop you off around the block
taylor_swift	Remember that she's getting older, too
taylor_swift	And don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJ's
taylor_swift	Getting ready for school
taylor_swift	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Just stay this little
taylor_swift	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	It could stay this simple
taylor_swift	And no one's ever burned you
taylor_swift	Nothing's ever left you scarred
taylor_swift	And even though you want to
taylor_swift	Just try to never grow up
taylor_swift	Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
taylor_swift	Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
taylor_swift	Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
taylor_swift	And all your little brother's favorite songs
taylor_swift	I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
taylor_swift	So here I am in my new apartment
taylor_swift	In a big city, they just dropped me off
taylor_swift	It's so much colder than I thought it would be
taylor_swift	So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
taylor_swift	Wish I'd never grown up
taylor_swift	I wish I'd never grown up
taylor_swift	Oh, I don't wanna grow up
taylor_swift	Wish I'd never grown up
taylor_swift	Could still be little
taylor_swift	Oh, I don't wanna grow up
taylor_swift	Wish I'd never grown up
taylor_swift	It could still be simple
taylor_swift	Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Just stay this little
taylor_swift	Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	It could stay this simple
taylor_swift	I won't let nobody hurt you
taylor_swift	Won't let no one break your heart
taylor_swift	And even though you want to
taylor_swift	Please try to never grow up
taylor_swift	Don't you ever grow up
taylor_swift	Never grow up
taylor_swift	Just never grow up
taylor_swift	We're all bored
taylor_swift	We're all so tired of everything
taylor_swift	We wait for
taylor_swift	Trains that just aren't coming
taylor_swift	We show off
taylor_swift	Our different scarlet letters
taylor_swift	Trust me, mine is better
taylor_swift	We're so young
taylor_swift	But we're on the road to ruin
taylor_swift	We play dumb
taylor_swift	But we know exactly what we're doin'
taylor_swift	We cry tears
taylor_swift	Of mascara in the bathroom
taylor_swift	Honey, life is just a classroom
taylor_swift	'Cause baby, I could build a castle
taylor_swift	Out of all the bricks they threw at me
taylor_swift	And every day is like a battle
taylor_swift	But every night with us is like a dream
taylor_swift	Baby, we're the new romantics
taylor_swift	Come on, come along with me
taylor_swift	Heartbreak is the national anthem
taylor_swift	We sing it proudly
taylor_swift	We are too busy dancing
taylor_swift	To get knocked off our feet
taylor_swift	Baby, we're the new romantics
taylor_swift	The best people in life are free
taylor_swift	We're all here
taylor_swift	The lights and noise are blinding
taylor_swift	We hang back
taylor_swift	It's all in the timing
taylor_swift	It's poker
taylor_swift	He can't see it in my face
taylor_swift	But I'm about to play my ace
taylor_swift	We need love
taylor_swift	But all we want is danger
taylor_swift	We team up
taylor_swift	Then switch sides like a record changer
taylor_swift	The rumors
taylor_swift	Are terrible and cruel
taylor_swift	But honey, most of them are true (ah)
taylor_swift	'Cause baby, I could build a castle
taylor_swift	Out of all the bricks they threw at me
taylor_swift	And every day is like a battle
taylor_swift	But every night with us is like a dream
taylor_swift	Baby, we're the new romantics
taylor_swift	Come on, come along with me
taylor_swift	Heartbreak is the national anthem
taylor_swift	We sing it proudly
taylor_swift	We are too busy dancing
taylor_swift	To get knocked off our feet
taylor_swift	Baby, we're the new romantics
taylor_swift	The best people in life are free
taylor_swift	So come on, come along with me
taylor_swift	The best people in life are free
taylor_swift	Please take my hand and
taylor_swift	Please take me dancing and
taylor_swift	Please leave me stranded
taylor_swift	It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
taylor_swift	'Cause baby, I could build a castle
taylor_swift	Out of all the bricks they threw at me
taylor_swift	And every day is like a battle
taylor_swift	But every night with us is like a dream
taylor_swift	'Cause baby, I could build a castle
taylor_swift	Out of all the bricks they threw at me
taylor_swift	And every day is like a battle

taylor_swift	The best people in life are free
taylor_swift	(talking)
taylor_swift	Wow it's been at least 5 years since I've seen her. Pfft it's hard to believe
taylor_swift	(singing)
taylor_swift	I can't believe it's been that long, why didn't your call, why didn't you write.
taylor_swift	Was it cause of him or was it just cause you don't love me anymore. 
taylor_swift	You could have found some way of contact me.
taylor_swift	But I know it's not my fault 
taylor_swift	Once he's gone I know you'll start to come around
taylor_swift	I know it's his fault now, you should have told me sooner, I wouldn't have had to live my life this way
taylor_swift	Now that he's gone will I get to see you again
taylor_swift	At least hear your voice again
taylor_swift	I think it's gonna workout this time around
taylor_swift	We can be a family again not like before is gonna be different,
taylor_swift	We're gonna do lot's of stuff together I think its gonna work out this time around not like before
taylor_swift	But I know it's not my fault 
taylor_swift	Once he's gone I know you'll start to come around
taylor_swift	I know it's his fault now, you should have told me sooner 
taylor_swift	I wouldn't have had to live my life this way cause I know it's not my fault now
taylor_swift	Standing on the border
taylor_swift	Looking out into the great unknown
taylor_swift	I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
taylor_swift	There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
taylor_swift	I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
taylor_swift	I'm gonna start all over again
taylor_swift	And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
taylor_swift	See how far I can go
taylor_swift	Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	And talk to someone I don't know
taylor_swift	I will face the world around me
taylor_swift	Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
taylor_swift	And I will fall in love again
taylor_swift	Because I can
taylor_swift	Gonna climb the mountain
taylor_swift	And look the eagle in the eye
taylor_swift	I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
taylor_swift	How could I have ever believed
taylor_swift	That love had to be so blind
taylor_swift	When freedom was waiting, down at the station
taylor_swift	All I had to do was make up my mind
taylor_swift	And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
taylor_swift	See how far I can go
taylor_swift	Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	And talk to someone I don't know
taylor_swift	I will face the world around me
taylor_swift	Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
taylor_swift	And I will fall in love again
taylor_swift	Because I can
taylor_swift	Well, I have walked through the fire
taylor_swift	And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
taylor_swift	Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out
taylor_swift	Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
taylor_swift	See how far I can go
taylor_swift	Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	And talk to someone I don't know
taylor_swift	Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
taylor_swift	I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
taylor_swift	Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
taylor_swift	Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything
taylor_swift	(Spoken):
taylor_swift	My name's Taylor Swift
taylor_swift	This is a cover song I'm gonna sing for you
taylor_swift	By one of my favorite bands called Better Than Ezra
taylor_swift	And its the song called Our Last Night
taylor_swift	We were standing in an empty room
taylor_swift	The moonlight was falling
taylor_swift	You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
taylor_swift	And I could have spent a life with you
taylor_swift	But those days were over
taylor_swift	You were calling my name when your face faded from view
taylor_swift	And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
taylor_swift	And wasn't it you who told me:
taylor_swift	Angels fly in the air tonight
taylor_swift	Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
taylor_swift	And stars collide and the air's alive
taylor_swift	Or was it just like those promises that you made
taylor_swift	On our last night?
taylor_swift	I remember waking up with you
taylor_swift	The days doing nothing
taylor_swift	You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.
taylor_swift	But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star
taylor_swift	A poet at a Nobel seminar
taylor_swift	I hope the world never tore that out of you
taylor_swift	Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
taylor_swift	Yeah wasn't it you who told me:
taylor_swift	Angels fly in the air tonight
taylor_swift	Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
taylor_swift	And stars collide and the air's alive
taylor_swift	Or was it just like those promises that you made
taylor_swift	On our last night?
taylor_swift	And what ever happened to the things you loved
taylor_swift	And the songs we played, and the indian days
taylor_swift	Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
taylor_swift	Like Harold and Maude and singing
taylor_swift	I was waving as you drove away
taylor_swift	The sunlight was falling
taylor_swift	You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane
taylor_swift	Angels fly in the air tonight
taylor_swift	And wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
taylor_swift	Oh oh yeah
taylor_swift	And stars collide and the air's alive
taylor_swift	Or was it just like those promises that you made
taylor_swift	On our last night?
taylor_swift	On our last night
taylor_swift	Oh oh oh oh oh
taylor_swift	I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
taylor_swift	In the front seat of his car
taylor_swift	He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
taylor_swift	The other on my heart
taylor_swift	I look around
taylor_swift	Turn the radio down
taylor_swift	He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
taylor_swift	I say, "Nothing,
taylor_swift	I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
taylor_swift	And he says:
taylor_swift	Our song is the slammin' screen door
taylor_swift	Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
taylor_swift	When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
taylor_swift	'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
taylor_swift	Our song is the way you laugh
taylor_swift	The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
taylor_swift	And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
taylor_swift	Askin' God if he could play it again
taylor_swift	I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
taylor_swift	Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
taylor_swift	And lost and thrown away
taylor_swift	Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
taylor_swift	I almost didn't notice all the roses
taylor_swift	And the note that said:
taylor_swift	Our song is the slammin' screen door
taylor_swift	Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
taylor_swift	When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
taylor_swift	'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
taylor_swift	Our song is the way you laugh
taylor_swift	The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
taylor_swift	And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
taylor_swift	Askin' God if he could play it again
taylor_swift	I've heard every album
taylor_swift	Listened to the radio
taylor_swift	Waited for something to come along
taylor_swift	That was as good as our song
taylor_swift	'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
taylor_swift	Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
taylor_swift	When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
taylor_swift	'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
taylor_swift	Our song is the way he laughs
taylor_swift	The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
taylor_swift	And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
taylor_swift	Askin' God if he could play it again
taylor_swift	Play it again
taylor_swift	I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
taylor_swift	In the front seat of his car
taylor_swift	I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
taylor_swift	And I wrote down our song
taylor_swift	Elevator buttons and morning air
taylor_swift	Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
taylor_swift	If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
taylor_swift	But right now, my time is theirs
taylor_swift	Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
taylor_swift	They'll judge it like they know about me and you
taylor_swift	And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
taylor_swift	The jury's out, but my choice is you
taylor_swift	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
taylor_swift	People throw rocks at things that shine
taylor_swift	And life makes love look hard
taylor_swift	The stakes are high, the water's rough
taylor_swift	But this love is ours
taylor_swift	You never know what people have up their sleeves
taylor_swift	Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
taylor_swift	Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
taylor_swift	But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine
taylor_swift	And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
taylor_swift	People throw rocks at things that shine
taylor_swift	And life makes love look hard
taylor_swift	The stakes are high, the water's rough
taylor_swift	But this love is ours
taylor_swift	And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
taylor_swift	And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
taylor_swift	And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
taylor_swift	'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
taylor_swift	And I love the riddles that you speak
taylor_swift	And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
taylor_swift	'Cause my heart is yours
taylor_swift	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
taylor_swift	People throw rocks at things that shine
taylor_swift	And life makes love look hard
taylor_swift	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
taylor_swift	People throw rocks at things that shine
taylor_swift	But they can't take what's ours
taylor_swift	They can't take what's ours
taylor_swift	The stakes are high, the waters rough
taylor_swift	But this love is ours
taylor_swift	Looking at it now
taylor_swift	It all seemed so simple
taylor_swift	We were lying on your couch
taylor_swift	I remember
taylor_swift	You took a Polaroid of us
taylor_swift	Then discovered (then discovered)
taylor_swift	The rest of the world is black and white
taylor_swift	But we were in screaming color
taylor_swift	And I remember thinkin'
taylor_swift	Are we out of the woods yet?
taylor_swift	Are we out of the woods yet?
taylor_swift	Are we out of the woods yet?
taylor_swift	Are we out of the woods?
taylor_swift	Are we in the clear yet?

taylor_swift	(Are we out of the woods?)
taylor_swift	Looking at it now
taylor_swift	Last December (last December)
taylor_swift	We were built to fall apart
taylor_swift	And fall back together (back together)
taylor_swift	Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
taylor_swift	On the night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided
taylor_swift	We decided to move the furniture so we could dance
taylor_swift	Baby like we stood a chance
taylor_swift	Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
taylor_swift	And I remember thinkin'
taylor_swift	Are we out of the woods yet?
taylor_swift	Are we out of the woods yet?
taylor_swift	Are we out of the woods yet?

taylor_swift	Are we in the clear yet?
taylor_swift	In the clear yet? Good
taylor_swift	(Are we out of the woods?)
taylor_swift	Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
taylor_swift	Twenty stitches in the hospital room
taylor_swift	And you started crying, baby I did too
taylor_swift	But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
taylor_swift	Remember when we couldn't take the heat
taylor_swift	I walked out and said I'm setting you free
taylor_swift	But the monsters turned out to be just trees
taylor_swift	But when the sun came up, you were looking at me
taylor_swift	You were looking at me, oh
taylor_swift	You were looking at me
taylor_swift	I remember
taylor_swift	Oh I remember
taylor_swift	Are we out of the woods yet?

taylor_swift	If you love me then I love you
taylor_swift	Swear by the freckles on the moon
taylor_swift	And maybe this will be enough
taylor_swift	I'd like to keep you 'till I'm old
taylor_swift	But if I can't at least I'll know
taylor_swift	That baby, Perfect Have I Loved
taylor_swift	Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
taylor_swift	Before September stole me away from you
taylor_swift	The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
taylor_swift	'Cos baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me
taylor_swift	Sayin'
taylor_swift	If you love me then I love you
taylor_swift	Swear by the freckles on the moon
taylor_swift	And maybe this will be enough
taylor_swift	I'd like to keep you till I'm old 
taylor_swift	But if I can't at least I'll know
taylor_swift	That baby, Perfect Have I Loved
taylor_swift	I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
taylor_swift	I found the feeling of trying to get lost
taylor_swift	You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
taylor_swift	It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet 
taylor_swift	And if you love me then I love you
taylor_swift	Swear by the freckles on the moon
taylor_swift	And maybe this will be enough
taylor_swift	I'd like to keep you till I'm old
taylor_swift	But if I can't at least I'll know
taylor_swift	That baby, Perfect Have I Loved
taylor_swift	Love was all we knew
taylor_swift	And faith was growing on the vines
taylor_swift	Words were all we had
taylor_swift	And for one Summer you were mine
taylor_swift	Sayin'
taylor_swift	If you love me then I love you
taylor_swift	Swear by the freckles on the moon
taylor_swift	And maybe, this will be enough
taylor_swift	I'd like to keep you till I'm old  
taylor_swift	But if I can't at least I'll know
taylor_swift	That baby, Perfect Have I Loved
taylor_swift	[Chorus]
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna make the very first scar
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
taylor_swift	Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
taylor_swift	And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
taylor_swift	No matter what you say I still can't believe
taylor_swift	That you would walk away
taylor_swift	It don't make sense to me but
taylor_swift	[Chorus]
taylor_swift	It's not unbroken anymore
taylor_swift	How do I get it back the way it was before
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna make the very first scar
taylor_swift	Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a
taylor_swift	[Chorus]

taylor_swift	A long time ago
taylor_swift	I ain't jealous of you
taylor_swift	Just thought you should know
taylor_swift	You were never good enough for him
taylor_swift	Or anything like me

taylor_swift	Sure had a good time
taylor_swift	Cleaning up that mess

taylor_swift	but he'll never find them all
taylor_swift	Tried to tape them back together

taylor_swift	So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
taylor_swift	That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
taylor_swift	By the way...
taylor_swift	I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive

taylor_swift	There's no time for tears
taylor_swift	I'm just sitting here planning my revenge

taylor_swift	From going out with all of your best friends

taylor_swift	My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
taylor_swift	I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive

taylor_swift	I don't know what I want
taylor_swift	So don't ask me 'cause I'm still trying to figure it out
taylor_swift	Don't know what's down this road
taylor_swift	I'm just walking, trying to see through the rain coming down
taylor_swift	Even though I'm not the only one who feels the way I do
taylor_swift	I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
taylor_swift	I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on

taylor_swift	Loving him is like
taylor_swift	Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
taylor_swift	Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
taylor_swift	Ending so suddenly
taylor_swift	Loving him is like
taylor_swift	Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
taylor_swift	Like the colors in autumn
taylor_swift	So bright, just before they lose it all
taylor_swift	Losing him was blue like I've never known
taylor_swift	Missing him was dark gray, all alone
taylor_swift	Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
taylor_swift	But loving him was red,loving him was red
taylor_swift	Touching him was like
taylor_swift	Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
taylor_swift	Memorizing him was as
taylor_swift	Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
taylor_swift	Fighting with him was like
taylor_swift	Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
taylor_swift	Regretting him was like
taylor_swift	Wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong
taylor_swift	Losing him was blue like I've never known
taylor_swift	Missing him was dark gray, all alone
taylor_swift	Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
taylor_swift	But loving him was red, oh, red, burning red
taylor_swift	Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
taylor_swift	Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
taylor_swift	But moving on from him is impossible
taylor_swift	When I still see it all in my head,in burning red
taylor_swift	Burning, it was red
taylor_swift	Losing him was blue like I'd ever known
taylor_swift	Missing him was dark gray, all alone
taylor_swift	Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
taylor_swift	'Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red
taylor_swift	And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
taylor_swift	Comes back to me, burning red
taylor_swift	His love was like
taylor_swift	Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
taylor_swift	It's 10am, I catch the morning train,
taylor_swift	And there you are, you smile, with a seat you've saved,
taylor_swift	Saying "hey, I've been waiting for ya".
taylor_swift	We'd talk about our dreams, you'd talk 'bout everything,
taylor_swift	We'd go so loud, but we don't care,
taylor_swift	Cause all we care is that we're having so much fun.
taylor_swift	You'd tell me 'bout your life, you'd learn a bit 'bout mine,
taylor_swift	And just like that I swear it's like we've known each other our whole lives.
taylor_swift	And this moment is perfect.
taylor_swift	Train tracks grind still everyone can hear us.
taylor_swift	Don't you dare be quiet.
taylor_swift	This journey's ours, yeah this journey's ours.
taylor_swift	Lets take the ride of our lives.
taylor_swift	This is the moment where the chemistry happens,
taylor_swift	Yeah that special connection.
taylor_swift	These are the days of our lives.
taylor_swift	These are the times you'll never forget.
taylor_swift	Never regret as long as we ride here side by side.
taylor_swift	We can speak, we can dream,
taylor_swift	This is our time, you and me,
taylor_swift	Let's have the ride of our lives.
taylor_swift	As we watch the world outside the window past,
taylor_swift	I'd pray, hoping that this moment lasts.
taylor_swift	It's hard not to laugh out loud baby when you crack a joke.
taylor_swift	You've got me smiling, got me thinking that I've got it all.
taylor_swift	You make a promise to me; promise this will be our tradition,
taylor_swift	Cause every time we ride together it's like stranger than fiction.
taylor_swift	I don't ever want this train ride to come to an end,
taylor_swift	But when it does baby, we can do it all over again.
taylor_swift	And the train's coming to a stop,
taylor_swift	I'm still so lost in you I can't bare to get off.
taylor_swift	You kiss me on the spot.
taylor_swift	See you tomorrow, yeah tomorrow we can
taylor_swift	I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
taylor_swift	I remember your little laugh
taylor_swift	Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
taylor_swift	I love you to the moon and back
taylor_swift	I remember your blue eyes, looking into mine
taylor_swift	Like we had our own secret club
taylor_swift	I remember you dancing, before bedtime
taylor_swift	Then jumping on me, waking me up
taylor_swift	I can still feel you hold my hand
taylor_swift	Little man, and even the moment I knew
taylor_swift	You fought it hard like an army guy
taylor_swift	Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
taylor_swift	Come on, baby, with me
taylor_swift	We're gonna fly away from here
taylor_swift	You were my best four years
taylor_swift	I remember the drive home, when the blind hope
taylor_swift	Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
taylor_swift	Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
taylor_swift	About a beautiful boy who died
taylor_swift	And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
taylor_swift	You wanted if you were still here
taylor_swift	I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
taylor_swift	I whispered in your ear
taylor_swift	Come on, baby, with me
taylor_swift	We're gonna fly away from here
taylor_swift	Out of this curtained room
taylor_swift	And this hospital grey 
taylor_swift	We'll just disappear
taylor_swift	Come on, baby, with me
taylor_swift	We're gonna fly away from here
taylor_swift	You were my best four years
taylor_swift	What if I'm standing in your closet, trying to talk to you?
taylor_swift	What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
taylor_swift	And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
taylor_swift	But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you
taylor_swift	Come on, baby, with me
taylor_swift	We're gonna fly away from here
taylor_swift	Come on, baby, with me 
taylor_swift	We're gonna fly away from here
taylor_swift	You were my best four years
taylor_swift	I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
taylor_swift	I love you to the moon and back
taylor_swift	There's a plane or a bus leaving from Dallas
taylor_swift	I hope you're on it
taylor_swift	If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
taylor_swift	I hope you caught it
taylor_swift	'Cause I swear out there ain't where
taylor_swift	You outta be
taylor_swift	So catch a ride or catch a cab
taylor_swift	Don't you know that I miss you bad
taylor_swift	But don't you walk to me
taylor_swift	Baby run
taylor_swift	Cut a path across the blue sky
taylor_swift	Straight in a straight line
taylor_swift	You can't get here fast enough
taylor_swift	Find a truck and fire it up
taylor_swift	Lean on the gas and off the clutch
taylor_swift	Leave Dallas in the dust
taylor_swift	I need you in a rush
taylor_swift	So baby run
taylor_swift	So baby run
taylor_swift	Oh if you aint got a suitcase
taylor_swift	Get a box
taylor_swift	Or an old brown paper sack
taylor_swift	Pack it light or pack it heavy
taylor_swift	Take a truck, take a Chevy
taylor_swift	Baby just come back
taylor_swift	There's a short cut to the highway out of town
taylor_swift	Why don't ya take it
taylor_swift	Don't let that speed limit slow ya down
taylor_swift	Go on and break it
taylor_swift	Baby break it
taylor_swift	And run
taylor_swift	Cut a path across the blue sky
taylor_swift	Straight in a straight line
taylor_swift	You can't get here fast enough
taylor_swift	Find a truck and fire it up
taylor_swift	Lean on the gas and off the clutch
taylor_swift	Leave Dallas in the dust
taylor_swift	I need you in a rush
taylor_swift	So baby run
taylor_swift	Run to me
taylor_swift	Baby run
taylor_swift	Run to me
taylor_swift	So baby run
taylor_swift	Run
taylor_swift	Oh baby run
taylor_swift	Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
taylor_swift	Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
taylor_swift	I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
taylor_swift	Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and long they will wait
taylor_swift	We had a beautiful magic love there
taylor_swift	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
taylor_swift	In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
taylor_swift	We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
taylor_swift	And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
taylor_swift	And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me
taylor_swift	'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
taylor_swift	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
taylor_swift	Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
taylor_swift	Silence, this train runs off its tracks
taylor_swift	Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
taylor_swift	Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
taylor_swift	A beautiful magic love there
taylor_swift	What a sad, beautiful, tragic
taylor_swift	Beautiful, tragic, beautiful
taylor_swift	What we had, a beautiful magic love there
taylor_swift	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
taylor_swift	We had a beautiful magic love there
taylor_swift	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
taylor_swift	I remember tears streaming down your face
taylor_swift	When I said, "I'll never let you go"
taylor_swift	When all those shadows almost killed your light
taylor_swift	I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
taylor_swift	But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
taylor_swift	Just close your eyes
taylor_swift	The sun is going down
taylor_swift	You'll be all right
taylor_swift	No one can hurt you now
taylor_swift	Come morning light
taylor_swift	You and I'll be safe and sound
taylor_swift	Don't you dare look out your window
taylor_swift	Darling, everything's on fire
taylor_swift	The war outside our door keeps raging on
taylor_swift	Hold on to this lullaby
taylor_swift	Even when the music's gone, gone
taylor_swift	Just close your eyes
taylor_swift	The sun is going down
taylor_swift	You'll be all right
taylor_swift	No one can hurt you now
taylor_swift	Come morning light
taylor_swift	You and I'll be safe and sound
taylor_swift	Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
taylor_swift	Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
taylor_swift	Just close your eyes
taylor_swift	You'll be all right
taylor_swift	Come morning light
taylor_swift	You and I'll be safe and sound
taylor_swift	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
taylor_swift	Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
taylor_swift	I've been an awful good girl, santa baby
taylor_swift	So hurry down the chimney tonight
taylor_swift	Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
taylor_swift	Well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
taylor_swift	So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
taylor_swift	Think of all the fun I've missed
taylor_swift	Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
taylor_swift	Next year I could be just as good
taylor_swift	If you check off my Christmas list
taylor_swift	Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
taylor_swift	I've been an angel all year, santa baby
taylor_swift	So hurry down the chimney tonight
taylor_swift	Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
taylor_swift	To a platinum mine, santa honey
taylor_swift	So hurry down the chimney tonight
taylor_swift	Come and trim my Christmas tree
taylor_swift	With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
taylor_swift	I really do believe in you
taylor_swift	Let's see if you believe in me
taylor_swift	Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
taylor_swift	A ring
taylor_swift	And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby
taylor_swift	So hurry down the chimney tonight

taylor_swift	That's what people say, mmh-hmm
taylor_swift	But I keep cruisin'

taylor_swift	Hey, hey, hey
taylor_swift	Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
taylor_swift	You could've been getting down to this sick beat
taylor_swift	My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
taylor_swift	She's like, "Oh my God"
taylor_swift	But I'm just gonna shake
taylor_swift	And to the fella over there

taylor_swift	It's strange to think,
taylor_swift	The songs we used to sing,
taylor_swift	The smiles,
taylor_swift	The flowers,
taylor_swift	Everything is gone
taylor_swift	Yesterday, I found out about you
taylor_swift	Even though I'm just looking at you,
taylor_swift	Feels wrong
taylor_swift	You say that you'd take it all back,
taylor_swift	Given one chance
taylor_swift	It was a moment of weakness,
taylor_swift	And you said, "yes"
taylor_swift	You should have said no
taylor_swift	You should have gone home
taylor_swift	You should have thought twice before you let it all go
taylor_swift	You should have known the word
taylor_swift	That what you did with her would get to me
taylor_swift	I should have been there in the back of your mind
taylor_swift	I shouldn't be asking myself why
taylor_swift	You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
taylor_swift	You should have said no,
taylor_swift	Baby, and you might still have me
taylor_swift	You can see that I've been crying
taylor_swift	Baby, you know all the right things to say
taylor_swift	But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
taylor_swift	We could ever be the same?
taylor_swift	You say that the past is the past
taylor_swift	You need one chance
taylor_swift	It was a moment of weakness,
taylor_swift	And you said, "yes"
taylor_swift	You should have said no
taylor_swift	You should have gone home
taylor_swift	You should have thought twice before you let it all go
taylor_swift	You should have known the word
taylor_swift	That what you did with her would get to me
taylor_swift	I should have been there in the back of your mind
taylor_swift	I shouldn't be asking myself why
taylor_swift	You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
taylor_swift	You should have said no,
taylor_swift	Baby, and you might still have me
taylor_swift	Oh, I can't resist
taylor_swift	Before you go,
taylor_swift	Tell me this,
taylor_swift	Was it worth it,
taylor_swift	Was she worth this?
taylor_swift	No, no, no, no, no
taylor_swift	You should have said no
taylor_swift	You should have gone home
taylor_swift	You should have thought twice before you let it all go
taylor_swift	You should have known the word
taylor_swift	That what you did with her would get to me
taylor_swift	I should have been there in the back of your mind
taylor_swift	I shouldn't be asking myself why
taylor_swift	You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
taylor_swift	You should have said no,
taylor_swift	Baby, and you might still have me
taylor_swift	Silent night, holy night
taylor_swift	All is calm and all is bright
taylor_swift	Round yon virgin mother and child
taylor_swift	Holy infant so tender and mild
taylor_swift	Sleep in heavenly peace
taylor_swift	Sleep in heavenly peace
taylor_swift	Silent night, holy night
taylor_swift	Shepherds quake at the sight
taylor_swift	Glories stream from Heaven afar
taylor_swift	Heavenly hosts sing halleluia
taylor_swift	Christ the savior is born
taylor_swift	Christ our savior is born
taylor_swift	Silent night, holy night
taylor_swift	Son of God
taylor_swift	Love's pure light
taylor_swift	Radiant beams from thy holy face
taylor_swift	With the dawn of redeeming grace
taylor_swift	Jesus Lord at thy birth
taylor_swift	Jesus Lord at thy birth
taylor_swift	Halleluia!
taylor_swift	Halleluia!
taylor_swift	Halleluia!
taylor_swift	Christ the savior is born
taylor_swift	Let's watch
taylor_swift	The tide chase
taylor_swift	The waves
taylor_swift	Onto the sand
taylor_swift	I wonder
taylor_swift	If a broken heart
taylor_swift	Feel the warmth
taylor_swift	On my hand
taylor_swift	And I wonder
taylor_swift	What a piece
taylor_swift	Of driftwood
taylor_swift	Has seen all through
taylor_swift	His lifetime
taylor_swift	Let's walk away
taylor_swift	The past through
taylor_swift	The smokey black nights
taylor_swift	I've seen
taylor_swift	A million things
taylor_swift	Spoke a million words
taylor_swift	Now I only want
taylor_swift	To speak to you
taylor_swift	Waiting for the words
taylor_swift	Counting every bird
taylor_swift	There's nothing
taylor_swift	I'd rather do
taylor_swift	On the
taylor_swift	Smokey black nights
taylor_swift	Still throught
taylor_swift	The haze
taylor_swift	I can make out
taylor_swift	Constellations
taylor_swift	I'll make one
taylor_swift	Of you and me
taylor_swift	As we sit
taylor_swift	In the sand
taylor_swift	And I saw
taylor_swift	That sunset gleamin
taylor_swift	As my eyes went wild
taylor_swift	Let's walk away
taylor_swift	The past through
taylor_swift	The smokey black nights
taylor_swift	I've played
taylor_swift	A thousand songs
taylor_swift	Sang a thousand words
taylor_swift	Now I only want
taylor_swift	To sing to you
taylor_swift	Waited on a wire
taylor_swift	Starin' at the fire
taylor_swift	There's nothing
taylor_swift	I'd rather do
taylor_swift	On the
taylor_swift	Smokey black nights
taylor_swift	I've walked
taylor_swift	A thousand miles
taylor_swift	Smiled
taylor_swift	A thousand smiles
taylor_swift	Now I only smile
taylor_swift	When I'm with you
taylor_swift	Waiting for the words
taylor_swift	Counting every bird
taylor_swift	There's nothing
taylor_swift	I'd rather do
taylor_swift	On the
taylor_swift	Smokey black nights
taylor_swift	So walk with me
taylor_swift	As the sweet
taylor_swift	Wind dances
taylor_swift	I'll write a song
taylor_swift	For you and me
taylor_swift	On the
taylor_swift	The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
taylor_swift	and I'm a house of cards
taylor_swift	You're the kind of reckless that you send me running but I
taylor_swift	kind of know that I won't get far.
taylor_swift	And you stood there in front of me just
taylor_swift	Close enough to touch
taylor_swift	Close enough to hope you couldn't see
taylor_swift	What I was thinking of
taylor_swift	Drop everything now
taylor_swift	Meet me in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	Kiss me on the sidewalk
taylor_swift	Take away the pain
taylor_swift	'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
taylor_swift	Get me with those green eyes, baby
taylor_swift	As the lights go down
taylor_swift	Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
taylor_swift	'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
taylor_swift	My mind forgets to remind me
taylor_swift	that you're a bad idea
taylor_swift	You touch me once and it's really something
taylor_swift	You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
taylor_swift	I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
taylor_swift	But with you, I know it's no good
taylor_swift	And I could wait patiently but
taylor_swift	I really wish you would
taylor_swift	Drop everything now
taylor_swift	Meet me in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	Kiss me on the sidewalk
taylor_swift	Take away the pain
taylor_swift	cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
taylor_swift	Get me with those green eyes, baby
taylor_swift	As the lights go down
taylor_swift	Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
taylor_swift	cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
taylor_swift	I run my fingers through your hair
taylor_swift	And watch the lights go wild
taylor_swift	Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
taylor_swift	It's just strong enough to make you feel right
taylor_swift	And lead me up the staircase
taylor_swift	Won't you whisper soft and slow
taylor_swift	I'm captivated by you, baby
taylor_swift	like a fireworks show
taylor_swift	Drop everything now
taylor_swift	Meet me in the pouring rain
taylor_swift	Kiss me on the sidewalk
taylor_swift	Take away the pain
taylor_swift	cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
taylor_swift	Get me with those green eyes, baby
taylor_swift	As the lights go down
taylor_swift	Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
taylor_swift	cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
taylor_swift	I am not the kind of girl
taylor_swift	Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
taylor_swift	But you are not the kind of boy
taylor_swift	Who should be marrying the wrong girl
taylor_swift	I sneak in and see your friends
taylor_swift	And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
taylor_swift	And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
taylor_swift	Somewhere back inside a room
taylor_swift	Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
taylor_swift	This is surely not what you thought it would be
taylor_swift	I lose myself in a daydream
taylor_swift	Where I stand and say
taylor_swift	Dont say "Yes", run away now
taylor_swift	Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
taylor_swift	Dont wait or say a single vow
taylor_swift	You need to hear me out
taylor_swift	And they said, "Speak now"
taylor_swift	Fond gestures are exchanged
taylor_swift	And the organ starts to play
taylor_swift	A song that sounds like a death march
taylor_swift	And I am hiding in the curtains
taylor_swift	It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
taylor_swift	She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
taylor_swift	But I know you wish it was me
taylor_swift	You wish it was me, dont you?
taylor_swift	Dont say "Yes", run away now
taylor_swift	Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
taylor_swift	Dont wait or say a single vow
taylor_swift	You need to hear me out
taylor_swift	And they said, "Speak now"
taylor_swift	Dont say "Yes", run away now
taylor_swift	Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
taylor_swift	Dont wait or say a single vow
taylor_swift	Your time is running out
taylor_swift	And they said, "Speak now"
taylor_swift	Oh, run away
taylor_swift	La la, oh oh
taylor_swift	Say a single vow
taylor_swift	I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
taylor_swift	Theres the silence, theres my last chance
taylor_swift	I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
taylor_swift	Horrified looks from everyone in the room
taylor_swift	But Im only looking at you
taylor_swift	I am not the kind of girl
taylor_swift	Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
taylor_swift	But you are not the kind of boy
taylor_swift	Who should be marrying the wrong girl
taylor_swift	Dont say "Yes", run away now
taylor_swift	Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
taylor_swift	Dont wait or say a single vow
taylor_swift	You need to hear me out
taylor_swift	And they said, "Speak now"
taylor_swift	And youll say "Lets run away now
taylor_swift	Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door
taylor_swift	Baby, I didnt say my vows
taylor_swift	So glad you were around
taylor_swift	When they said, 'Speak now'"
taylor_swift	You were the guy I always dreamed of. 
taylor_swift	You were the guy that I loved. 
taylor_swift	But then you had to leave me.
taylor_swift	I asked when you would call me.
taylor_swift	You replied meet me at the wildernes at nine.
taylor_swift	I went there standin waitin to see your face.... 
taylor_swift	You never showed up I was there for hours, I was waitin to see your face. 
taylor_swift	I'll stand here for hours under this lonely spot light.
taylor_swift	I'll wait all night till I see your face. 
taylor_swift	Ohh waitin to see your face. 
taylor_swift	I went to the mall with all my friends to see if you were there 
taylor_swift	I saw you with another girl 
taylor_swift	I didn't think to swear. 
taylor_swift	I went home crying to see if you were there 
taylor_swift	If a message was left I would cry my tears.
taylor_swift	I was watin to see your face. 
taylor_swift	I'll stand here for hours under this lonely spot light.
taylor_swift	I'll wait all night till I see your face. 
taylor_swift	Ohh waitin to see your face. 
taylor_swift	Then I had your call for me and I saw your face lookin at me 
taylor_swift	I was glad to see! 
taylor_swift	We went we cried to the the wilderness---Im not alone.. 
taylor_swift	Under the spot light any more.... 
taylor_swift	Any more--- any more--- ANY MORE!
taylor_swift	I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
taylor_swift	It was the best night
taylor_swift	Never would forget how we moved
taylor_swift	The whole place was dressed to the nines
taylor_swift	And we were dancing, dancing
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight
taylor_swift	I'm a Barbie on the boardwalk
taylor_swift	Summer of '45
taylor_swift	Picked me up late one night
taylor_swift	Out the window, we were seventeen
taylor_swift	And crazy, running wild, wild
taylor_swift	Can't remember what song
taylor_swift	It was playing when we walked in
taylor_swift	The night we snuck into a yacht club party
taylor_swift	Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
taylor_swift	I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
taylor_swift	It was the best night
taylor_swift	Never would forget how we moved
taylor_swift	The whole place was dressed to the nines
taylor_swift	And we were dancing, dancing
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
taylor_swift	He said "Look at you, worrying too much about,
taylor_swift	Things you can't change.
taylor_swift	You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
taylor_swift	If you keep thinking that away."
taylor_swift	He was trying to skip rocks
taylor_swift	On the ocean saying to me
taylor_swift	"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
taylor_swift	Don't you dream impossible things?"
taylor_swift	Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
taylor_swift	It was the best night
taylor_swift	Never would forget how we moved.
taylor_swift	The whole place was dressed to the nines
taylor_swift	And we were dancing, dancing
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
taylor_swift	Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
taylor_swift	Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
taylor_swift	Ooh, ooh, we could get married
taylor_swift	Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
taylor_swift	Oh my, what a marvelous tune
taylor_swift	It was the best night
taylor_swift	Never would forget how we moved
taylor_swift	The whole place was dressed to the nines
taylor_swift	And we were dancing, dancing
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
taylor_swift	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
taylor_swift	Like we dream impossible dreams
taylor_swift	Like starlight, starlight
taylor_swift	Like we dream impossible dreams
taylor_swift	Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
taylor_swift	Don't you dream impossible things?
taylor_swift	I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
taylor_swift	Busy streets and busy lives
taylor_swift	And all we know is touch and go
taylor_swift	We are alone with our changing minds
taylor_swift	We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
taylor_swift	And I never saw you coming
taylor_swift	And I'll never be the same
taylor_swift	You come around and the armor falls
taylor_swift	Pierce the room like a cannonball
taylor_swift	Now all we know is don't let go
taylor_swift	We are alone, just you and me
taylor_swift	Up in your room and our slates are clean
taylor_swift	Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
taylor_swift	So you were never a saint
taylor_swift	And I've loved in shades of wrong
taylor_swift	We learn to live with the pain
taylor_swift	Mosaic broken hearts
taylor_swift	But this love is brave and wild
taylor_swift	And I never saw you coming
taylor_swift	And I'll never be the same
taylor_swift	This is a state of grace
taylor_swift	This is the worthwhile fight
taylor_swift	Love is a ruthless game
taylor_swift	Unless you play it good and right
taylor_swift	These are the hands of fate
taylor_swift	You're my Achilles' heel
taylor_swift	This is the golden age of something good and right and real
taylor_swift	And I never saw you coming
taylor_swift	And I'll never be the same
taylor_swift	I never saw you coming
taylor_swift	And I'll never be the same
taylor_swift	This is a state of grace
taylor_swift	This is the worthwhile fight
taylor_swift	Love is a ruthless game
taylor_swift	Unless you play it good and right
taylor_swift	Cory's eyes are like a jungle
taylor_swift	He smiles it's like the radio
taylor_swift	He whispers songs into my window
taylor_swift	In words that nobody knows
taylor_swift	There's pretty girls on every corner
taylor_swift	They watch his as he's walking home
taylor_swift	Saying does he know
taylor_swift	Will you ever know?
taylor_swift	You're beautiful
taylor_swift	Every little piece, love
taylor_swift	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
taylor_swift	Ask anyone
taylor_swift	And when you find everything you looked for
taylor_swift	I hope your life leads you back to my door
taylor_swift	Oh, but, if it don't
taylor_swift	stay beautiful
taylor_swift	Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
taylor_swift	I'm taking pictures in my mind
taylor_swift	So, I can save them for a rainy day
taylor_swift	It's hard to make conversation,
taylor_swift	When he's takin' my breath away
taylor_swift	I should say,
taylor_swift	Hey, by the way
taylor_swift	You're beautiful
taylor_swift	Every little piece, love
taylor_swift	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
taylor_swift	Ask anyone
taylor_swift	And when you find everything you looked for
taylor_swift	I hope your life leads you back to my door
taylor_swift	Oh, but, if it don't
taylor_swift	stay beautiful
taylor_swift	If you and I are a story,
taylor_swift	That never gets told
taylor_swift	If what you are is a daydream,
taylor_swift	I'll never get to hold
taylor_swift	At least you'll know
taylor_swift	You're beautiful
taylor_swift	Every little piece, love
taylor_swift	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
taylor_swift	Ask anyone
taylor_swift	And when you find everything you looked for
taylor_swift	I hope your life leads you back to my front door
taylor_swift	Oh, but, if it don't
taylor_swift	Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
taylor_swift	Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
taylor_swift	Oh, if it don't,
taylor_swift	Stay beautiful
taylor_swift	Stay beautiful
taylor_swift	I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
taylor_swift	I threw my phone across the room at you
taylor_swift	I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
taylor_swift	But you stayed
taylor_swift	This morning I said we should talk about it
taylor_swift	'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
taylor_swift	That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
taylor_swift	And said "Okay, let's talk."
taylor_swift	And I said "Stay, stay, stay.
taylor_swift	I've been loving you,
taylor_swift	For quite some time, time, time."
taylor_swift	You think that it's funny
taylor_swift	When I'm mad, mad, mad
taylor_swift	But I think that it's best
taylor_swift	If we both stay
taylor_swift	Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
taylor_swift	Who took all of their problems out on me
taylor_swift	But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
taylor_swift	I love you because you have given me no choice
taylor_swift	But to stay, stay, stay
taylor_swift	I've been loving you
taylor_swift	For quite some time, time, time
taylor_swift	You think that it's funny
taylor_swift	When I'm mad, mad, mad
taylor_swift	But I think that it's best
taylor_swift	If we both stay, stay, stay, stay
taylor_swift	You took the time to memorize me
taylor_swift	My fears, my hopes and dreams
taylor_swift	I just like hanging out with you
taylor_swift	All the time
taylor_swift	All those times that you didn't leave
taylor_swift	It's been occurring to me
taylor_swift	I'd like to hang out with you
taylor_swift	For my whole life
taylor_swift	Stay
taylor_swift	And I'll be loving you
taylor_swift	For quite some time
taylor_swift	No one else is gonna love me
taylor_swift	When I get mad, mad, mad
taylor_swift	So I think that it's best
taylor_swift	If we both stay, stay
taylor_swift	Stay, stay, stay, stay
taylor_swift	Stay, stay, stay
taylor_swift	I've been loving you
taylor_swift	For quite some time, time, time
taylor_swift	You think that it's funny
taylor_swift	When I'm mad, mad, mad
taylor_swift	But I think that it's best
taylor_swift	If we both stay, stay
taylor_swift	Stay, stay, stay, stay
taylor_swift	Stay, stay, stay
taylor_swift	I've been loving you
taylor_swift	For quite some time, time, time
taylor_swift	You think that it's funny
taylor_swift	When I'm mad, mad, mad
taylor_swift	But I think that it's best
taylor_swift	If we both stay
taylor_swift	That's so fun!
taylor_swift	Let me know how's it feel 
taylor_swift	To be under my skin
taylor_swift	Wrapped around my heart
taylor_swift	Is it like anywhere you've been?
taylor_swift	And everything I do, I do it just for you
taylor_swift	So why the hell don't you love me?
taylor_swift	Why the hell don't you need me 
taylor_swift	Like I need you?
taylor_swift	Why are you so far above me?
taylor_swift	Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
taylor_swift	But I was just a toy
taylor_swift	That's what you destroyed
taylor_swift	Stupid boy
taylor_swift	I have been, looking in
taylor_swift	Trying to read your mind
taylor_swift	Give you the benefit of the doubt
taylor_swift	Every single time
taylor_swift	But didn't you waltz right by
taylor_swift	I'm screamin' out inside
taylor_swift	Why the hell don't you love me?
taylor_swift	Why the hell don't you need me 
taylor_swift	Like I need you?
taylor_swift	Why are you so far above me?
taylor_swift	Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do? 
taylor_swift	But I was just a toy
taylor_swift	That's what you destroyed
taylor_swift	Stupid boy
taylor_swift	What happens when you wake up
taylor_swift	And see what you've lost
taylor_swift	Take one look at me cause
taylor_swift	That's what it  cost
taylor_swift	I was gonna be everything you need
taylor_swift	Cause you are everything to me
taylor_swift	So why the hell don't you love me?
taylor_swift	Why the hell don't you need me 
taylor_swift	Like I need you?
taylor_swift	Why are you so far above me?
taylor_swift	Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
taylor_swift	But I was just a toy
taylor_swift	That's  what you destroyed
taylor_swift	Stupid boy
taylor_swift	Let me know how's it feel 
taylor_swift	To be under my skin
taylor_swift	Midnight
taylor_swift	You come and pick me up, no headlights
taylor_swift	Long drive
taylor_swift	Could end in burning flames or paradise
taylor_swift	Fade into view, oh
taylor_swift	It's been a while since I have even heard from you
taylor_swift	(Heard from you)
taylor_swift	I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
taylor_swift	Know exactly where it leads but I
taylor_swift	Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
taylor_swift	You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
taylor_swift	And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
taylor_swift	And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
taylor_swift	'Cause we never go out of style
taylor_swift	We never go out of style
taylor_swift	You got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
taylor_swift	And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
taylor_swift	And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
taylor_swift	We never go out of style
taylor_swift	We never go out of style
taylor_swift	So it goes
taylor_swift	He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
taylor_swift	Takes me home
taylor_swift	Lights are off, he's taking off his coat
taylor_swift	I say I heard, oh
taylor_swift	That you've been out and about with some other girl
taylor_swift	Some other girl
taylor_swift	He says what you heard is true but I
taylor_swift	Can't stop thinking about you and I
taylor_swift	I said I've been there too a few times
taylor_swift	'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
taylor_swift	And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
taylor_swift	And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
taylor_swift	'Cause we never go out of style
taylor_swift	We never go out of style
taylor_swift	You got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
taylor_swift	And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
taylor_swift	And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
taylor_swift	'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)
taylor_swift	We never go out of style
taylor_swift	Take me home
taylor_swift	Just take me home
taylor_swift	Yeah, just take me home
taylor_swift	(Out of style)
taylor_swift	Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
taylor_swift	And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
taylor_swift	And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
taylor_swift	'Cause we never go out of style
taylor_swift	We never go out of style
taylor_swift	Tall, dark, and Superman
taylor_swift	He puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
taylor_swift	To save the world or go to work
taylor_swift	It's the same thing to me
taylor_swift	He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
taylor_swift	I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
taylor_swift	I hang on every word you say, yeah
taylor_swift	And you'll smile and say, how are you?
taylor_swift	I'll say just fine
taylor_swift	I always forget to tell you I love you
taylor_swift	I'll love you forever
taylor_swift	I watched Superman fly away
taylor_swift	You've got a busy day today
taylor_swift	Go save the world, I'll be around
taylor_swift	And I watched Superman fly away
taylor_swift	Come back, I'll be with you someday
taylor_swift	I'll be right here on the ground
taylor_swift	When you come back down
taylor_swift	Tall, dark, and beautiful
taylor_swift	He's complicated, he's irrational
taylor_swift	But I hope someday he'll take me away
taylor_swift	And save the day, yeah
taylor_swift	Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
taylor_swift	He's not all bad like his reputation
taylor_swift	And I can't hear one single word they said
taylor_swift	And you'll leave, got places to be
taylor_swift	And I'll be okay
taylor_swift	I always forget to tell you I love you
taylor_swift	I loved you from the very first day
taylor_swift	I watched Superman fly away
taylor_swift	You've got a busy day today
taylor_swift	Go save the world, I'll be around
taylor_swift	And I watched Superman fly away
taylor_swift	Come back, I'll be with you someday
taylor_swift	I'll be right here on the ground
taylor_swift	When you come back down
taylor_swift	And I watch you fly around the world
taylor_swift	And I hope you don't save some other girl
taylor_swift	Don't forget, don't forget about me
taylor_swift	I'm far away, but I never let you go
taylor_swift	I'm love struck, and looking out the window
taylor_swift	Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
taylor_swift	Right here wishing the flowers were from you
taylor_swift	Wishing the card was from you
taylor_swift	Wishing the car was from you
taylor_swift	'Cause I loved you from the very first day
taylor_swift	I watched Superman fly away
taylor_swift	You've got a busy day today
taylor_swift	Go save the world, I'll be around, forever and ever
taylor_swift	And I watched Superman fly away
taylor_swift	I swear, I'll be with you someday
taylor_swift	I'll be right here on the ground
taylor_swift	When you come back down
taylor_swift	When you come back down
taylor_swift	This is wrong but
taylor_swift	I can't help but feel like
taylor_swift	There ain't nothing more right babe
taylor_swift	Misty morning comes again and I can't
taylor_swift	Help but wish I could see your face
taylor_swift	And I knew from the first note played I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
taylor_swift	You smile that beautiful smile
taylor_swift	And all the girls in the front row scream your name
taylor_swift	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
taylor_swift	I can't take my eyes off of you
taylor_swift	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
taylor_swift	Who's desperately in love with you
taylor_swift	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
taylor_swift	Superstar
taylor_swift	Good morning loneliness
taylor_swift	Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
taylor_swift	When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
taylor_swift	And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
taylor_swift	Counting down the ways to see you
taylor_swift	And you smile that beautiful smile
taylor_swift	And all the girls in the front row scream your name
taylor_swift	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
taylor_swift	I can't take my eyes off of you
taylor_swift	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
taylor_swift	Who's desperately in love with you
taylor_swift	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
taylor_swift	Superstar
taylor_swift	You played in bars, you play guitar
taylor_swift	And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
taylor_swift	And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
taylor_swift	Every night from the radio
taylor_swift	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
taylor_swift	I can't take my eyes off of you
taylor_swift	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
taylor_swift	Who's desperately in love with you
taylor_swift	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
taylor_swift	Superstar
taylor_swift	Sweet, sweet superstar
taylor_swift	Superstar
taylor_swift	Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
taylor_swift	Wilson County creek
taylor_swift	Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
taylor_swift	Baby, you were watching me
taylor_swift	Cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
taylor_swift	Slowly educating me
taylor_swift	I never had a lesson so sweet
taylor_swift	You can get high on a first kiss
taylor_swift	You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
taylor_swift	You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
taylor_swift	Nothings shatterproof
taylor_swift	You can crash and burn and come back someone new
taylor_swift	And thats what I learned from you
taylor_swift	Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
taylor_swift	Just like the two of us
taylor_swift	Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
taylor_swift	Guess I loved you way too much
taylor_swift	But Im a little smarter, my hearts a little harder
taylor_swift	But its still soft enough to cry
taylor_swift	Cause I remember those times
taylor_swift	I remember
taylor_swift	You can get high on a first kiss
taylor_swift	You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
taylor_swift	You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
taylor_swift	Nothings shatterproof
taylor_swift	You can crash and burn and come back someone new
taylor_swift	And thats what I learned from you
taylor_swift	Saw you just the other day
taylor_swift	All that I could think to say was,
taylor_swift	Hey, how have you been?
taylor_swift	You caught me with that old smile
taylor_swift	Said, Its really been a while,
taylor_swift	Still think about back when
taylor_swift	We used to get high on the first kiss
taylor_swift	We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
taylor_swift	And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
taylor_swift	Nothings shatterproof
taylor_swift	You can crash and burn and now Im someone new
taylor_swift	And thats what I learned from you
taylor_swift	Oh, thats what I learned from you
taylor_swift	Thats what I learned from you, oh you, oh
taylor_swift	Thats what I learned from you, oh yeah
taylor_swift	Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh) 
taylor_swift	Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no" 
taylor_swift	You never saw it coming 
taylor_swift	Except when you started running 
taylor_swift	And now you come undone (I, I, I) 
taylor_swift	Seen you fall, seen you crawl on you knees (eh, eh) 
taylor_swift	Seen you lost in a crowd, seen you colors fade 
taylor_swift	Wish I could make it better 
taylor_swift	Someday you won't remember, 
taylor_swift	This pain you thought would last forever and ever 
taylor_swift	There you stand, ten feet tall 
taylor_swift	I will say, "I knew it all along" 
taylor_swift	Your eyes are wider than distance 
taylor_swift	This life is sweeter than fiction 
taylor_swift	Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh) 
taylor_swift	All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes 
taylor_swift	They never saw it coming 
taylor_swift	You hit the ground running 
taylor_swift	And now you're on to something 
taylor_swift	I, I, I say 
taylor_swift	What a sight, what a sight when the light came on 
taylor_swift	Put me right, threw me right when you put them front 
taylor_swift	And in this perfect weather

taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	Hey, a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?
taylor_swift	Tim McGraw: 
taylor_swift	I have heard this song.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	It was awesome. Uh, except for I didn't know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more... I don't know if it's true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old. I don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	Why don't we find out? Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Oh it's definitely a compliment. Yeah.
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Nice-
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Nice to meet you.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	I'm doing great. How are you doing?
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record! It's doing great.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker. 
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	Well-
taylor_swift	Taylor: 
taylor_swift	The funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer, some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but, I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so. I kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out.
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Well I'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	So I-
taylor_swift	So I understand that you two guys have not talked?
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	No.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	You haven't met?
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	No.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	No, we've never talked or met or anything.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly or something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message. So, I don't know if she got it or not.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Oh my God. They never gave that to me.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	They didn't? Okay well, there ya go. I did.
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	So I-I
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Not at all.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called "Tim McGraw" without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad. I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Could you tell Faith that I said hello?
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Oh my gosh, she's awesome.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	I agree.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	This, this... tell me about writing a song. Um did this, did this really happen?
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw. Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Now I feel old.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Aww, thank you.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes "well that's your first single"
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	"And I'm like "well..."
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Well you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor.
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Alright, great.
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Well congratulations 'cause it's your first single, first top ten hit and that's pretty exciting and I know you're off to the races here. You're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Awesome, it's been so exciting. Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Um I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that.
taylor_swift	*laughs*
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Well I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Ya do? What would-
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Yeah.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	What would their name be?
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	Uh, um I think Taylor something.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Something like that yeah.
taylor_swift	Taylor:
taylor_swift	But-
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Well I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.
taylor_swift	Taylor: 
taylor_swift	Just consider it.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	Ah, well that's very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.
taylor_swift	Tim:
taylor_swift	Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.
taylor_swift	DJ:
taylor_swift	I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.

taylor_swift	Drew looks at me
taylor_swift	I fake a smile so he won't see
taylor_swift	That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
taylor_swift	I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
taylor_swift	And she's got everything that I have to live without
taylor_swift	Drew talks to me
taylor_swift	I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
taylor_swift	That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
taylor_swift	He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
taylor_swift	I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
taylor_swift	He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
taylor_swift	The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
taylor_swift	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
taylor_swift	Drew walks by me
taylor_swift	Can he tell that I can't breathe?
taylor_swift	And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
taylor_swift	She better hold him tight, give him all her love
taylor_swift	Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
taylor_swift	He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
taylor_swift	The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
taylor_swift	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
taylor_swift	So I drive home alone
taylor_swift	As I turn out the light
taylor_swift	I'll put his picture down
taylor_swift	And maybe get some sleep tonight
taylor_swift	'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
taylor_swift	The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
taylor_swift	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
taylor_swift	He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
taylor_swift	And he's all that I need to fall into
taylor_swift	Drew looks at me
taylor_swift	I fake a smile so he won't see
taylor_swift	Drew looks at me
taylor_swift	I fake a smile so he won't see
taylor_swift	What I want and I need
taylor_swift	And everything that we should be

taylor_swift	And he's all that I need to fall into
taylor_swift	Drew looks at me
taylor_swift	I fake a smile so he won't see
taylor_swift	I took a chance, I took a shot
taylor_swift	And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
taylor_swift	You took a swing, I took it hard
taylor_swift	And down here from the ground I see who you are
taylor_swift	I'm sick and tired of your attitude
taylor_swift	I'm feeling like I don't know you
taylor_swift	You tell me that you love me then cut me down
taylor_swift	And I need you like a heartbeat
taylor_swift	But you know you got a mean streak
taylor_swift	Makes me run for cover when you're around
taylor_swift	And here's to you and your temper
taylor_swift	Yes, I remember what you said last night
taylor_swift	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
taylor_swift	Tell me why
taylor_swift	You could write a book on 
taylor_swift	How to ruin someone's perfect day
taylor_swift	Well, I get so confused and frustrated
taylor_swift	Forget what I'm trying to say
taylor_swift	I'm sick and tired of your reasons
taylor_swift	I got no one to believe in
taylor_swift	You tell me that you want me, then push me around
taylor_swift	And I need you like a heartbeat
taylor_swift	But you know you got a mean streak
taylor_swift	Makes me run for cover when you're around
taylor_swift	And here's to you and your temper
taylor_swift	Yes, I remember what you said last night
taylor_swift	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
taylor_swift	Tell me why
taylor_swift	Why do you have to make me feel small
taylor_swift	So you can feel whole inside?
taylor_swift	Why do you have to put down my dreams
taylor_swift	So you're the only thing on my mind?
taylor_swift	And I'm sick and tired of your attitude
taylor_swift	I'm feeling like I don't know you
taylor_swift	You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
taylor_swift	I'm sick and tired of your reasons
taylor_swift	I got no one to believe in
taylor_swift	You ask me for my love then you push me around
taylor_swift	Here's to you and your temper
taylor_swift	Yes, I remember what you said last night
taylor_swift	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
taylor_swift	Tell me why, why, tell me why
taylor_swift	I take a step back, and let you go
taylor_swift	I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know
taylor_swift	(Spoken:)
taylor_swift	This one goes out to all my fans!
taylor_swift	I'd just like to say
taylor_swift	How everyday
taylor_swift	You guys make life rock
taylor_swift	I depend on you
taylor_swift	For your support
taylor_swift	And what do ya know
taylor_swift	You were always there
taylor_swift	When I needed you

taylor_swift	And I appreciate it
taylor_swift	Thank you
taylor_swift	For everything
taylor_swift	I wouldn't be here without you
taylor_swift	Thank you
taylor_swift	I love you all
taylor_swift	Oh yeah
taylor_swift	Thank you all
taylor_swift	I said I know
taylor_swift	He said I need some time, need some space
taylor_swift	To think about all of this
taylor_swift	I watched him go
taylor_swift	He watched me crash to the floor
taylor_swift	On my knees, just like that
taylor_swift	He said, "When can I come back?"
taylor_swift	I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
taylor_swift	That's when after sun is always storming
taylor_swift	Laughing when I'm crying
taylor_swift	And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
taylor_swift	That's when if I see your face
taylor_swift	I'll let you in, baby that's when
taylor_swift	I said I know
taylor_swift	He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
taylor_swift	Put you through all of this
taylor_swift	'Cause I let you go, you let me think
taylor_swift	That I'll be fine without you
taylor_swift	Imagine that
taylor_swift	So baby when can I come back
taylor_swift	I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
taylor_swift	That's when after sun is always storming
taylor_swift	Laughing when I'm crying
taylor_swift	That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
taylor_swift	That's when if I see your face
taylor_swift	I'll let you in, baby that's when
taylor_swift	And I said all this playing
taylor_swift	Did you ever think of me
taylor_swift	And he said
taylor_swift	That's when I woke up in the morning
taylor_swift	That's when after sun is always storming
taylor_swift	Laughing when I was crying
taylor_swift	That's when we were waiting at the front gate
taylor_swift	That's when, when I saw your face
taylor_swift	You let me in, and baby that's when
taylor_swift	I said I know
taylor_swift	He said I need some time, need some space
taylor_swift	I'm five years old 
taylor_swift	Its getting cold out, got my big coat on 
taylor_swift	I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you 
taylor_swift	I run and run, past the pumpkin patch, and the tractor rides 
taylor_swift	Look now, the sky is gold 
taylor_swift	I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 
taylor_swift	I dont know why all the trees change in the fall 
taylor_swift	I know youre not scared of anything at all 
taylor_swift	Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away 
taylor_swift	But I know I had the best day with you today 
taylor_swift	I'm thirteen now 
taylor_swift	And dont know how my friends could be so mean 
taylor_swift	I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys 
taylor_swift	And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away 
taylor_swift	And we talk and window shop til I forgot all their names 
taylor_swift	I dont know who I'm gonna talk to now at school 
taylor_swift	But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you 
taylor_swift	Dont know how long its gonna take to feel ok 
taylor_swift	But I know I had the best day with you today 
taylor_swift	I have an excellent father 
taylor_swift	His strength is making me stronger 
taylor_swift	God smiles on my little brother 
taylor_swift	Inside and out hes better than I am 
taylor_swift	I grew up in a pretty house 
taylor_swift	And I had space to run 
taylor_swift	And I had the best days with you 
taylor_swift	There is a video I found from back when I was three 
taylor_swift	You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me 
taylor_swift	Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
taylor_swift	And daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 
taylor_swift	Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
taylor_swift	I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
taylor_swift	And I love you for giving me your eyes 
taylor_swift	Staying back and watching me shine 
taylor_swift	And I didnt know if you knew so I'm taking this chance to say 
taylor_swift	That I had the best day with you today

taylor_swift	Last time I'm asking you this
taylor_swift	New to town with a made-up name,
taylor_swift	In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
taylor_swift	And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
taylor_swift	You had it figured out since you were in school
taylor_swift	Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
taylor_swift	So overnight you look like a sixties queen
taylor_swift	Another name goes up in lights
taylor_swift	Like diamonds in the sky
taylor_swift	And theyll tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	Yeah, they tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	But can you tell me now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one?
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, oh
taylor_swift	Now its big black cars and Riviera views
taylor_swift	And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
taylor_swift	And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
taylor_swift	And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
taylor_swift	'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
taylor_swift	And all the young things line up to take your place
taylor_swift	Another name goes up in lights
taylor_swift	You wonder if youll make it out alive
taylor_swift	And theyll tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	Yeah, they'll tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	Can you tell me now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one?
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, oh
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, oh
taylor_swift	It was a few years later I showed up here
taylor_swift	And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
taylor_swift	How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
taylor_swift	They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
taylor_swift	Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
taylor_swift	And it took some time but I understand it now
taylor_swift	Cause now my name is up in lights
taylor_swift	But I think you got it right
taylor_swift	Let me tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	Let me tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	Let me tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, oh
taylor_swift	Yeah, they'll tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	Yeah, they'll tell you now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one
taylor_swift	Can you tell me now
taylor_swift	Youre the lucky one?
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, oh
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, oh
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, oh
taylor_swift	Hey
taylor_swift	Don't write yourself off yet
taylor_swift	It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
taylor_swift	Just try your best
taylor_swift	Try everything you can
taylor_swift	Don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away
taylor_swift	It just takes some time
taylor_swift	Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
taylor_swift	Everything everything will be just fine
taylor_swift	Everything everything will be all right, all right
taylor_swift	Hey you know they're all the same
taylor_swift	You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in
taylor_swift	Live right now
taylor_swift	Just be yourself
taylor_swift	It doesn't matter if it's good enough, for someone else
taylor_swift	It just takes some time
taylor_swift	Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
taylor_swift	Everything everything will be just fine
taylor_swift	Everything everything will be all right, all right (x2)
taylor_swift	Hey - don't write yourself off yet
taylor_swift	It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
taylor_swift	Just do your best
taylor_swift	Do everything you can
taylor_swift	Don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say
taylor_swift	It just takes some time
taylor_swift	Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
taylor_swift	Everything everything will be just fine, everything everything will be all right.
taylor_swift	You should have been there
taylor_swift	Should have burst through the door
taylor_swift	With that "Baby, I'm right here." smile
taylor_swift	And it would've felt like
taylor_swift	A million little shining stars had just aligned
taylor_swift	And I would've been so happy
taylor_swift	Christmas lights glisten
taylor_swift	I've got my eye on the door
taylor_swift	Just waiting for you to walk in
taylor_swift	But the time is ticking
taylor_swift	People ask me how I've been
taylor_swift	As I comb back through my memory
taylor_swift	How you said you'd be here
taylor_swift	You said you'd be here
taylor_swift	And it was like slow motion
taylor_swift	Standing there in my party dress
taylor_swift	In red lipstick
taylor_swift	With no one to impress
taylor_swift	And they're all laughing
taylor_swift	As I'm looking around the room
taylor_swift	But there's one thing missing
taylor_swift	And that was the moment I knew
taylor_swift	And the hours pass by
taylor_swift	Now I just wanna be alone
taylor_swift	But your close friends always seem to know
taylor_swift	When there's something really wrong
taylor_swift	So they follow me down the hall
taylor_swift	And there in the bathroom
taylor_swift	I try not to fall apart
taylor_swift	And the sinking feeling starts
taylor_swift	As I say hopelessly
taylor_swift	"He said he'd be here."
taylor_swift	And it was like slow motion
taylor_swift	Standing there in my party dress
taylor_swift	In red lipstick
taylor_swift	With no one to impress
taylor_swift	And they're all laughing
taylor_swift	And asking me about you
taylor_swift	But there's one thing missing
taylor_swift	And that was the moment I knew
taylor_swift	What do you say
taylor_swift	When ears are streaming down your face
taylor_swift	In front of everyone you know?
taylor_swift	And what do you do
taylor_swift	When the one who means the most to you
taylor_swift	Is the one who didn't show?
taylor_swift	You should have been here
taylor_swift	And I would've been so happy
taylor_swift	And it was like slow motion
taylor_swift	Standing there in my party dress
taylor_swift	In red lipstick
taylor_swift	With no one to impress
taylor_swift	And they're all standing around me singing
taylor_swift	"Happy birthday to you."
taylor_swift	But there's one thing missing
taylor_swift	And that was the moment I knew
taylor_swift	Ooh, I knew.
taylor_swift	You call me later
taylor_swift	And say "I'm sorry I didn't make it."
taylor_swift	And I say "I'm sorry, too."
taylor_swift	And that was the moment I knew
taylor_swift	In the heat of the fight
taylor_swift	I walked away.
taylor_swift	Ignoring words that you were saying
taylor_swift	Trying to make me stay.
taylor_swift	I said "This time I had enough."
taylor_swift	And you've called a hundred times
taylor_swift	But I'm not pickin' up.
taylor_swift	'cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over.
taylor_swift	But if you look a little closer
taylor_swift	I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
taylor_swift	To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
taylor_swift	Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
taylor_swift	Wait there in the pourin' rain,
taylor_swift	Come back for more!
taylor_swift	And don't you leave,
taylor_swift	'cause I know all I need is on
taylor_swift	The other side of the door.
taylor_swift	Me and my stupid pride
taylor_swift	Sittin' here alone.
taylor_swift	Going through the photographs,
taylor_swift	Staring at the phone.
taylor_swift	I keep going back over
taylor_swift	The things we both said.
taylor_swift	And I remember the slammin' door,
taylor_swift	And all the things that I misread.
taylor_swift	Baby you know everything,
taylor_swift	Tell me why you couldn't see
taylor_swift	That when I left I wanted you to
taylor_swift	Chase after me? Yeah,
taylor_swift	I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
taylor_swift	To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
taylor_swift	Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
taylor_swift	Wait there in the pourin' rain,
taylor_swift	Come back for more!
taylor_swift	And don't you leave,
taylor_swift	'cause I know all I need is on
taylor_swift	The other side of the door.
taylor_swift	And I scream out the window
taylor_swift	"I can't even look at you, I don't need you!",
taylor_swift	But I do, I do, I do...
taylor_swift	"See, there's nothing you can say
taylor_swift	To make right again, I mean it, I mean it!",
taylor_swift	What I mean is:
taylor_swift	I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
taylor_swift	To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
taylor_swift	Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
taylor_swift	Wait there in the pourin' rain,
taylor_swift	Come back for more
taylor_swift	And don't you leave,
taylor_swift	'cause I know all I need is on
taylor_swift	The other side of the door.
taylor_swift	With your face,
taylor_swift	And your beautiful eyes,
taylor_swift	And the conversation,
taylor_swift	With the little white lies.
taylor_swift	And the faded picture
taylor_swift	Of a beautiful night
taylor_swift	You carry me from your car
taylor_swift	Up the stairs
taylor_swift	And I broke-down cryin'
taylor_swift	Was it worth this mess?
taylor_swift	After everything and that little black dress
taylor_swift	After everything, I must confess,
taylor_swift	I need you
taylor_swift	I didn't know,
taylor_swift	What I would find,
taylor_swift	When I went lookin' for a reason
taylor_swift	I know,
taylor_swift	I didn't read,
taylor_swift	Between the lines,
taylor_swift	And baby I've got nowhere to go
taylor_swift	I tried to take the road less traveled by
taylor_swift	But nothing seems to work the first few times
taylor_swift	Am I right?
taylor_swift	So how can I ever,
taylor_swift	try to be better
taylor_swift	Nobody ever, 
taylor_swift	let's me in
taylor_swift	And I can still see you,
taylor_swift	This ain't the best view
taylor_swift	On the outside looking in
taylor_swift	I've been a lot of lonely places
taylor_swift	I've never been on the outside
taylor_swift	You saw me there, 
taylor_swift	But never knew
taylor_swift	That I would give it all just to be
taylor_swift	A part of this,
taylor_swift	A part of you
taylor_swift	And now it's all too late
taylor_swift	So you see,
taylor_swift	You could have helped if you had wanted to
taylor_swift	But, no one notices until it's too late to do anything
taylor_swift	So how can I ever,
taylor_swift	try to be better
taylor_swift	Nobody ever, 
taylor_swift	let's me in
taylor_swift	And I can still see you,
taylor_swift	This ain't the best view
taylor_swift	On the outside looking in
taylor_swift	I've been a lot of lonely places
taylor_swift	I've never been on the outside
taylor_swift	Oh, yeah
taylor_swift	How can I ever,
taylor_swift	try to be better
taylor_swift	Nobody ever, 
taylor_swift	let's me in
taylor_swift	And I can still see you,
taylor_swift	This ain't the best view
taylor_swift	On the outside looking in
taylor_swift	I've been a lot of lonely places
taylor_swift	I've never been on the outside
taylor_swift	Oh oh
taylor_swift	Ah, oh oh
taylor_swift	Oh oh
taylor_swift	Oh oh
taylor_swift	I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
taylor_swift	How we met and the sparks flew instantly
taylor_swift	And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
taylor_swift	I used to know my place was the spot next to you
taylor_swift	Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
taylor_swift	'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
taylor_swift	Oh, a simple complication, 
taylor_swift	Miscommunications lead to fallout
taylor_swift	So many things that I wish you knew
taylor_swift	So many walls up, I can't break through
taylor_swift	Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
taylor_swift	And we're not speaking
taylor_swift	And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
taylor_swift	Like it's killing me, yeah
taylor_swift	I don't know what to say
taylor_swift	Since the twist of fate
taylor_swift	When it all broke down
taylor_swift	And the story of us
taylor_swift	Looks a lot like a tragedy now
taylor_swift	Next chapter!
taylor_swift	How'd we end up this way?
taylor_swift	See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
taylor_swift	And you're doing your best to avoid me
taylor_swift	I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
taylor_swift	How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
taylor_swift	But you held your pride, like you should've held me
taylor_swift	Oh, I'm scared to see the ending 
taylor_swift	Why are we pretending this is nothing?
taylor_swift	I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
taylor_swift	I've never heard silence quite this loud
taylor_swift	Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
taylor_swift	And we're not speaking
taylor_swift	And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
taylor_swift	Like it's killing me, yeah
taylor_swift	I don't know what to say
taylor_swift	Since the twist of fate
taylor_swift	When it all broke down
taylor_swift	And the story of us
taylor_swift	Looks a lot like a tragedy now
taylor_swift	This is looking like a contest
taylor_swift	Of who can act like they care less
taylor_swift	But I liked it better when you were on my side
taylor_swift	The battle's in your hands now
taylor_swift	But I would lay my armor down
taylor_swift	If you say you'd rather love than fight
taylor_swift	So many things that you wish I knew
taylor_swift	But the story of us might be ending soon
taylor_swift	Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
taylor_swift	And we're not speaking
taylor_swift	And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
taylor_swift	Like it's killing me, yeah
taylor_swift	But I don't know what to say
taylor_swift	Since the twist of fate
taylor_swift	When it all broke down
taylor_swift	And the story of us
taylor_swift	Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
taylor_swift	And we're not speaking
taylor_swift	And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
taylor_swift	Like it's killing me, yeah
taylor_swift	I don't know what to say
taylor_swift	Since the twist of fate
taylor_swift	'Cause we're going down
taylor_swift	And the story of us
taylor_swift	Looks a lot like a tragedy now
taylor_swift	The end.

taylor_swift	And all my single friends are jealous
taylor_swift	He says everything I need to hear and it's like
taylor_swift	I couldn't ask for anything better
taylor_swift	He opens up my door and I get into his car
taylor_swift	And he says you look beautiful tonight
taylor_swift	And I feel perfectly fine
taylor_swift	But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
taylor_swift	And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
taylor_swift	You're so in love that you act insane
taylor_swift	And that's the way I loved you
taylor_swift	Breakin' down and coming undone
taylor_swift	It's a roller coaster kinda rush
taylor_swift	And I never knew I could feel that much
taylor_swift	And that's the way I loved you
taylor_swift	He respects my space
taylor_swift	And never makes me wait
taylor_swift	And he calls exactly when he says he will
taylor_swift	He's close to my mother
taylor_swift	Talks business with my father
taylor_swift	He's charming and endearing
taylor_swift	And I'm comfortable
taylor_swift	But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
taylor_swift	And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
taylor_swift	You're so in love that you act insane
taylor_swift	And that's the way I loved you
taylor_swift	Breakin' down and coming undone

taylor_swift	And you were wild and crazy
taylor_swift	Just so frustrating, intoxicating

taylor_swift	She acts like shes 5 years old
taylor_swift	Since it's cold she's got her big coat on
taylor_swift	I hear people laugh at her
taylor_swift	I look up bored
taylor_swift	And she cries and runs
taylor_swift	We start throwing stuff at her and she tries to hide
taylor_swift	This starts to get old
taylor_swift	She hugs her legs
taylor_swift	And we put her to sleep
taylor_swift	Im forced to take her home
taylor_swift	And she's stupid to not know why the trees change in the fall.
taylor_swift	And I know that she is scared
taylor_swift	Of every little thing and all
taylor_swift	She thinks snow whites house very near how dumb
taylor_swift	But I know we had the worst day
taylor_swift	Ever today.
taylor_swift	She starts acting like shes 13 and thinks everyone is mean
taylor_swift	She starts crying
taylor_swift	And I push her away
taylor_swift	And cut her with my keys
taylor_swift	And she starts to drive and drive until she found a town far enough away
taylor_swift	And she sulks and walks and  tries to forget all our names
taylor_swift	And she know if shes ever going to finish school
taylor_swift	And she knows shell never laugh
taylor_swift	Cause we shrunk and she grew
taylor_swift	She dont know how long it'll take to feel okay
taylor_swift	But she knows she had the wors day ever today
taylor_swift	She had a bullying father
taylor_swift	She thought she was getting stronger
taylor_swift	Her mom beats up her little brother
taylor_swift	Inside and out hes more popular than she is
taylor_swift	She grew up in an ugly house
taylor_swift	And had no space to run
taylor_swift	And she had the worst days with me
taylor_swift	There was a video I found from back when we were three
taylor_swift	She was trying to paint in the kitchen and she was talking to me
taylor_swift	It was the age of teasing and bullying and throwing eggs at her window
taylor_swift	And her dad was super dumb 
taylor_swift	And I was the most handsome boy
taylor_swift	In the whole wide world
taylor_swift	And now she knows why
taylor_swift	All the trees change in the fall
taylor_swift	And she knows I was never on her side
taylor_swift	And always said she was wrong
taylor_swift	And she hates me
taylor_swift	For giving her the evil eyes
taylor_swift	And making her feel like 
taylor_swift	She could shine
taylor_swift	And I dont know if she knew
taylor_swift	So I'm taking this chance to say 
taylor_swift	That I always have the worst days
taylor_swift	When I'm with you.
taylor_swift	Should have been different but
taylor_swift	It wasn't different, was it
taylor_swift	Same old story, dear john, and so long
taylor_swift	Should have fit like a glove
taylor_swift	Should have fit like a ring
taylor_swift	Like a diamond ring
taylor_swift	A token of true love
taylor_swift	Should have all worked out
taylor_swift	But it didn't
taylor_swift	She should be here now
taylor_swift	But she isn't
taylor_swift	There's your trouble, there's your trouble
taylor_swift	You keep seeing double with the wrong one
taylor_swift	You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
taylor_swift	But you just keep holding on
taylor_swift	There's your trouble
taylor_swift	So now you're thinking 'bout
taylor_swift	All you're missing -- how
taylor_swift	Deep you're sinking, round and round and dragging down
taylor_swift	Why don't you cash in your chips
taylor_swift	Why don't you call it a loss
taylor_swift	Not such a big loss, chalk it up better luck
taylor_swift	Could have been true love
taylor_swift	But it wasn't
taylor_swift	It should all add up
taylor_swift	But it doesn't
taylor_swift	There's your trouble, there's your trouble
taylor_swift	You keep seeing double with the wrong one
taylor_swift	You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
taylor_swift	But you just keep holding on

taylor_swift	Should have all worked out
taylor_swift	But it didn't

taylor_swift	And I could go
taylor_swift	On and on, on and on and I will
taylor_swift	Skies grow darker
taylor_swift	Currents swept you out again
taylor_swift	And you were just
taylor_swift	Gone and gone, gone and gone
taylor_swift	In silent screams
taylor_swift	And wildest dreams

taylor_swift	Struggle through the night for someone new
taylor_swift	And, yeah, I could go
taylor_swift	On and on, on and on

taylor_swift	But you're still
taylor_swift	Gone, gone, gone

taylor_swift	But you come back to what you need
taylor_swift	This love is good, this love is bad
taylor_swift	This love is a life back from the dead, oh
taylor_swift	These hands had to let it go free
taylor_swift	And this love came back to me, oh

taylor_swift	[Taylor Swift]
taylor_swift	Hello??
taylor_swift	Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
taylor_swift	Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
taylor_swift	You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
taylor_swift	But, that's not true 'cause I know you
taylor_swift	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
taylor_swift	The water's high and you're jumping into it
taylor_swift	And letting go
taylor_swift	And no one knows, 
taylor_swift	That you cry,
taylor_swift	But, you don't tell anyone
taylor_swift	That you might not be the golden one
taylor_swift	And you're tied together with a smile
taylor_swift	But, you're coming undone
taylor_swift	I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
taylor_swift	'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
taylor_swift	Hoping it will end up in his pocket
taylor_swift	But, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
taylor_swift	Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
taylor_swift	It's not his price to pay
taylor_swift	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
taylor_swift	The water's high and you're jumping into it
taylor_swift	And letting go
taylor_swift	And no one knows, 
taylor_swift	That you cry,
taylor_swift	But, you don't tell anyone
taylor_swift	That you might not be the golden one
taylor_swift	And you're tied together with a smile
taylor_swift	But, you're coming undone
taylor_swift	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
taylor_swift	The water's high and you're jumping into it
taylor_swift	And letting go
taylor_swift	And no one knows, 
taylor_swift	That you cry,
taylor_swift	But, you don't tell anyone
taylor_swift	That you might not be the golden one
taylor_swift	And you're tied together with a smile
taylor_swift	But, you're coming undone
taylor_swift	You're tied together with a smile
taylor_swift	But, you're coming undone
taylor_swift	Goodbye, baby,
taylor_swift	With a smile
taylor_swift	Baby, baby, oh
taylor_swift	Do you remember the day
taylor_swift	I leaned up against your car
taylor_swift	And it started rolling down the street
taylor_swift	You screamed and ran after it
taylor_swift	And tried to open the door
taylor_swift	And it ran over your foot
taylor_swift	And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.
taylor_swift	It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
taylor_swift	It takes five seconds to need you
taylor_swift	When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
taylor_swift	'Cause they don't know to play our song
taylor_swift	I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
taylor_swift	I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
taylor_swift	'Cause that's where you belong
taylor_swift	Until Brad Pitt comes along
taylor_swift	Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
taylor_swift	And you said it reminded you of me
taylor_swift	And I threw the remote at you
taylor_swift	And you said "my point exactly"
taylor_swift	And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
taylor_swift	You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.
taylor_swift	It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
taylor_swift	It takes five seconds to need you
taylor_swift	When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
taylor_swift	'Cause they don't know to play our song
taylor_swift	I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
taylor_swift	I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
taylor_swift	'Cause that's where you belong
taylor_swift	Until Brad Pitt comes along
taylor_swift	You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
taylor_swift	But I swear I'd be careful with it
taylor_swift	If you gave me a ring
taylor_swift	And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
taylor_swift	It takes five seconds to need you
taylor_swift	When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
taylor_swift	'Cause they don't play our song
taylor_swift	I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
taylor_swift	I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
taylor_swift	'Cause that's where you belong
taylor_swift	Until Brad Pitt comes along
taylor_swift	'Til Brad Pitt comes along
taylor_swift	Yeah, oh oh
taylor_swift	Until Brad Pitt comes along
taylor_swift	He said the way my blue eyes shined
taylor_swift	Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
taylor_swift	I said, "That's a lie"
taylor_swift	Just a boy in a Chevy truck
taylor_swift	That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
taylor_swift	On backroads at night
taylor_swift	And I was right there beside him all summer long
taylor_swift	And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
taylor_swift	But when you think Tim McGraw
taylor_swift	I hope you think my favorite song
taylor_swift	The one we danced to all night long
taylor_swift	The moon like a spotlight on the lake
taylor_swift	When you think happiness
taylor_swift	I hope you think that little black dress
taylor_swift	Think of my head on your chest
taylor_swift	And my old faded blue jeans
taylor_swift	When you think Tim McGraw
taylor_swift	I hope you think of me
taylor_swift	September saw a month of tears
taylor_swift	And thankin' God that you weren't here
taylor_swift	To see me like that
taylor_swift	But in a box beneath my bed
taylor_swift	Is a letter that you never read
taylor_swift	From three summers back
taylor_swift	It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
taylor_swift	And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
taylor_swift	When you think Tim McGraw
taylor_swift	I hope you think my favorite song
taylor_swift	The one we danced to all night long
taylor_swift	The moon like a spotlight on the lake
taylor_swift	When you think happiness
taylor_swift	I hope you think that little black dress
taylor_swift	Think of my head on your chest
taylor_swift	And my old faded blue jeans
taylor_swift	When you think Tim McGraw
taylor_swift	I hope you think of me
taylor_swift	And I'm back for the first time since then
taylor_swift	I'm standin' on your street
taylor_swift	And there's a letter left on your doorstep
taylor_swift	And the first thing that you'll read is:
taylor_swift	When you think Tim McGraw
taylor_swift	I hope you think my favorite song
taylor_swift	Someday you'll turn your radio on
taylor_swift	I hope it takes you back to that place
taylor_swift	When you think happiness
taylor_swift	I hope you think that little black dress
taylor_swift	Think of my head on your chest
taylor_swift	And my old faded blue jeans
taylor_swift	When you think Tim McGraw
taylor_swift	I hope you think of me
taylor_swift	Oh, think of me, mmm
taylor_swift	He said the way my blue eyes shine
taylor_swift	Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
taylor_swift	I said, "That's a lie"
taylor_swift	You take all the words you said to her and put them up as a wall of gray,
taylor_swift	Protecting yourself from the world that you believe in, 
taylor_swift	I didn't know you would be able to say all the things you did so I take them and put them up as a wall of gray, 
taylor_swift	Protecting myself from the world I believe in
taylor_swift	She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, 
taylor_swift	While you ignored the world and listend to the fray,
taylor_swift	And you said you wouldn't be imbarassed if you said that word again but we both go imbarassed when we said her name
taylor_swift	The words written on the wall didn't have anything against anybody, 
taylor_swift	We're not in a war so what are we fighting for, 
taylor_swift	I don't know so just shut-up and say all the thing you've wanted to say, 
taylor_swift	The page filled with words in gray and it's about you
taylor_swift	I've never been anywhere cold as you,
taylor_swift	You give rainy endings to perfect days, 
taylor_swift	That's why I hate you for who you are
taylor_swift	If you were the only thing I needed we wouldn't be this way, 
taylor_swift	So she just said everything, everybody wanted her to say,
taylor_swift	But I'm not gonna say it oh, no, no, no
taylor_swift	She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, 
taylor_swift	You promised me everything I wanted but you gave it to everybody else instead,
taylor_swift	But you never gave us a damn thing so we cry,
taylor_swift	Cry alone or is it together I don't know
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	You were the prince
taylor_swift	I used to be a damsel in distress
taylor_swift	You took me by the hand
taylor_swift	And you picked me up at six
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	I wore a dress
taylor_swift	You wore a dark grey T-shirt
taylor_swift	You told me I was pretty
taylor_swift	When I looked like a mess
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	Time slows down
taylor_swift	Whenever you're around
taylor_swift	But can you feel this magic in the air?
taylor_swift	It must have been the way you kissed me
taylor_swift	Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
taylor_swift	It must have been the way
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	It must have been the way
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	You've got a smile
taylor_swift	That takes me to another planet
taylor_swift	Every move you make
taylor_swift	Everything you say is right
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	All that I can say
taylor_swift	Is now it's getting so much clearer
taylor_swift	Nothing made sense
taylor_swift	Till the time I saw your face
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	Time slows down
taylor_swift	Whenever you're around, yeah
taylor_swift	But can you feel this magic in the air?
taylor_swift	It must have been the way you kissed me
taylor_swift	Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
taylor_swift	It must have been the way
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	It must have been the way
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	Time slows down
taylor_swift	Whenever you're around
taylor_swift	I can feel my heart
taylor_swift	It's beating in my chest
taylor_swift	Did you feel it?
taylor_swift	I can't put this down
taylor_swift	But can you feel this magic in the air?
taylor_swift	It must have been the way you kissed me
taylor_swift	Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
taylor_swift	It must have been the way
taylor_swift	But can you feel this magic in the air?
taylor_swift	It must have been the way you kissed me
taylor_swift	Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
taylor_swift	It must have been the way
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	It must have been the way
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	Oh, oh, yeah, oh
taylor_swift	Today was a fairytale
taylor_swift	The lies are always better left unsaid
taylor_swift	So take the photos down of the wall
taylor_swift	There's nothing left to talk about
taylor_swift	We're in a plane and I want out
taylor_swift	From all these stories that people tell
taylor_swift	Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
taylor_swift	I guess it feels worse
taylor_swift	Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
taylor_swift	I guess it feels worse
taylor_swift	When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
taylor_swift	When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
taylor_swift	Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
taylor_swift	Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
taylor_swift	Now you know exactly how I feel
taylor_swift	The truth is out and I can see what's real
taylor_swift	There's nothing left to talk about
taylor_swift	We're in a scene and I want out
taylor_swift	From all these stories that people tell
taylor_swift	Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
taylor_swift	I guess it feels worse
taylor_swift	Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
taylor_swift	I guess it feels worse
taylor_swift	When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
taylor_swift	When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
taylor_swift	Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
taylor_swift	Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
taylor_swift	Tonight is our last night alone dear
taylor_swift	When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
taylor_swift	When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
taylor_swift	Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
taylor_swift	Tonight is our last night
taylor_swift	Tonight is our last night
taylor_swift	Tonight is our last night
taylor_swift	Tonight is our last night
taylor_swift	Tonight is our last night
taylor_swift	Tonight is our last night
taylor_swift	Put your lips close to mine
taylor_swift	As long as they don't touch
taylor_swift	Out of focus, eye to eye
taylor_swift	Till the gravity is too much
taylor_swift	And I'll do anything you say
taylor_swift	If you say it with your hands
taylor_swift	And I'd be smart to walk away
taylor_swift	But you're quicksand
taylor_swift	This slope is treacherous
taylor_swift	This path is reckless
taylor_swift	This slope is treacherous
taylor_swift	And I, I, I like it
taylor_swift	I can't decide if it's a choice
taylor_swift	Getting swept away
taylor_swift	I hear the sound of my own voice
taylor_swift	Asking you to stay
taylor_swift	And all we are is skin and bone
taylor_swift	Trained to get along
taylor_swift	Forever going with the flow
taylor_swift	But you're friction
taylor_swift	This slope is treacherous
taylor_swift	This path is reckless
taylor_swift	This slope is treacherous
taylor_swift	I, I, I like it
taylor_swift	Two headlights shine
taylor_swift	Through the sleepless night

taylor_swift	You walked me to the front door and said
taylor_swift	I love you and I'd never break your heart
taylor_swift	You were so perfect 
taylor_swift	You really lead me on
taylor_swift	And gave me everything I ever wanted
taylor_swift	Going out for dinner every night 
taylor_swift	Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
taylor_swift	Going out to the football games
taylor_swift	And then talking till sunrise
taylor_swift	You gave me this and put me down 
taylor_swift	I really thought we would improve

taylor_swift	I hope shes worth it 
taylor_swift	Going out for dinner every night 
taylor_swift	Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
taylor_swift	Going out to the football games
taylor_swift	And then talking till sunrise
taylor_swift	You gave me this and put me down
taylor_swift	Oh Oh Oh  
taylor_swift	You were unperfect
taylor_swift	Untouchable like a distant diamond sky.
taylor_swift	I'm reachin out and I just can't tell you why.
taylor_swift	I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you.
taylor_swift	Untouchable burning brighter than the sun,
taylor_swift	And when you're close I feel like coming undone.
taylor_swift	In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
taylor_swift	It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
taylor_swift	You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
taylor_swift	Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.
taylor_swift	It's half full and I won't wait here all day.

taylor_swift	But you're untouchable burning brighter than the sun,
taylor_swift	Now that you're close I feel like coming undone.
taylor_swift	In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
taylor_swift	It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
taylor_swift	You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
taylor_swift	Come on, come on, oh

taylor_swift	I remember when we broke up the first time
taylor_swift	Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
taylor_swift	'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
taylor_swift	When you said you needed space...what?
taylor_swift	Then you come around again and say
taylor_swift	"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
taylor_swift	Remember how that lasted for a day?
taylor_swift	I say "I hate you," we break up, you call me, I love you
taylor_swift	Ooh, we called it off again last night
taylor_swift	But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
taylor_swift	We are never ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	We are never ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
taylor_swift	But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever
taylor_swift	I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
taylor_swift	And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
taylor_swift	And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
taylor_swift	With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
taylor_swift	Ooh, you called me up again tonight
taylor_swift	But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
taylor_swift	We are never ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	We are never ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
taylor_swift	But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	Ooh (yeah)
taylor_swift	Ooh (yeah)
taylor_swift	Ooh (yeah)
taylor_swift	Oh
taylor_swift	I used to think that we were forever, ever
taylor_swift	And I used to say "Never say never..."
taylor_swift	...So he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you," and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
taylor_swift	You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.
taylor_swift	No, we are never ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	We are never ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
taylor_swift	But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	We, ooh, ooh, getting back together
taylor_swift	We, ooh, oh, getting back together
taylor_swift	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
taylor_swift	But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
taylor_swift	We used to walk along the street
taylor_swift	When the porch lights were shining bright
taylor_swift	Before I had somewhere to be
taylor_swift	Back when we had all night
taylor_swift	And we were happy
taylor_swift	I do recall a good while back
taylor_swift	We snuck into the circus
taylor_swift	You threw your arms around my neck
taylor_swift	Back when I deserved it
taylor_swift	And we were happy
taylor_swift	When it was good baby,
taylor_swift	It was good baby
taylor_swift	We showed 'um all up
taylor_swift	No one could touch the way we
taylor_swift	Laughed in the dark
taylor_swift	Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
taylor_swift	We were gonna buy someday
taylor_swift	And we were happy
taylor_swift	We used to watch the sun go down
taylor_swift	On the boats in the water
taylor_swift	That's sorta how I feel right now
taylor_swift	And Goodbye's so much harder
taylor_swift	'Cause we were happy
taylor_swift	When it was good baby,
taylor_swift	It was good baby
taylor_swift	We showed 'um all up
taylor_swift	No one could touch the way we
taylor_swift	Laughed in the dark
taylor_swift	Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
taylor_swift	We were gonna buy someday
taylor_swift	And we were happy
taylor_swift	Oh, I hate those voices
taylor_swift	Telling me I'm not in love anymore
taylor_swift	But they don't give me choices
taylor_swift	And that's what these tears are for
taylor_swift	'Cause we were happy
taylor_swift	We Were Happy
taylor_swift	When it was good baby,
taylor_swift	It was good baby
taylor_swift	We showed 'um all up
taylor_swift	No one could touch the way we
taylor_swift	Laughed in the dark
taylor_swift	Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
taylor_swift	And you were gonna marry me
taylor_swift	When we were happy
taylor_swift	Yeah, We were were happy
taylor_swift	Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
taylor_swift	We Were happy
taylor_swift	Turn WYCD on
taylor_swift	You're on your Grunwald
taylor_swift	Back from the Amazon
taylor_swift	Ah huh huh
taylor_swift	He's here with doctor Don
taylor_swift	I heard they dropped him off
taylor_swift	In the amazon
taylor_swift	Ah huh huh
taylor_swift	He caught an anaconda
taylor_swift	Ate some piranhas
taylor_swift	That's kinda disgusting
taylor_swift	But whatever makes you happy
taylor_swift	And I heard some naked boy
taylor_swift	Showed him around
taylor_swift	Yeah
taylor_swift	Grunwald's back in town
taylor_swift	Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
taylor_swift	Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
taylor_swift	Everybody here wanted something more
taylor_swift	Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

taylor_swift	 That you were gonna make me cry
taylor_swift	 It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
taylor_swift	 'Cause I know that you're living a lie

taylor_swift	 That he's doing to you
taylor_swift	 What you did to me
taylor_swift	 Girl you got what you deserved

taylor_swift	The moments getting nearer
taylor_swift	She thinks about it as she walks her walk

taylor_swift	School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer
taylor_swift	Theres one guy, shes shy, sees him through the mirror
taylor_swift	And everybody looks at her,
taylor_swift	She thinks about it

taylor_swift	I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
taylor_swift	Just like the ones I used to know
taylor_swift	Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
taylor_swift	To hear sleigh bells in the snow
taylor_swift	I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
taylor_swift	With every Christmas card I write
taylor_swift	May your days be merry and bright
taylor_swift	And may all your Christmases be white
taylor_swift	I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
taylor_swift	Just like the ones I used to know
taylor_swift	So may your days be merry and bright
taylor_swift	And may all your Christmases be white
taylor_swift	May your days be merry and bright
taylor_swift	And may all your Christmases be white
taylor_swift	Say you're sorry, that face of an angel, comes out, just when you need it to
taylor_swift	As I paced back and forth, all this time, 'cause I honestly believed in, you
taylor_swift	Holdin' on, the days drag on
taylor_swift	Stupid girl, I should have known, I should have known
taylor_swift	That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
taylor_swift	I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
taylor_swift	This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
taylor_swift	I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
taylor_swift	Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around
taylor_swift	Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
taylor_swift	My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
taylor_swift	I had so many dreams about you and me
taylor_swift	Happy endings, now I know
taylor_swift	That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
taylor_swift	I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
taylor_swift	This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
taylor_swift	I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
taylor_swift	Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around
taylor_swift	And there you are on your knees
taylor_swift	Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
taylor_swift	Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry
taylor_swift	'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
taylor_swift	I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
taylor_swift	This is a big world, that was a small town
taylor_swift	There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
taylor_swift	And it's too late for you and your white horse
taylor_swift	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
taylor_swift	To catch me now
taylor_swift	Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
taylor_swift	Try and catch me now oh-oh
taylor_swift	It's too late, to catch me now
taylor_swift	You walk in here with your guitar man
taylor_swift	Your shiny boots and your full on band
taylor_swift	A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
taylor_swift	Singing songs you gotta memorize
taylor_swift	With whatever talent money buys
taylor_swift	So polished that it slips right through your hands
taylor_swift	Don't worry yourself I ain't your competition
taylor_swift	Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention
taylor_swift	I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
taylor_swift	Let's talk about what you do that I can't
taylor_swift	Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
taylor_swift	And who wins
taylor_swift	Let's talk about what you did to get here
taylor_swift	Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
taylor_swift	Let's talk about what you wanna be
taylor_swift	And who I've always been
taylor_swift	I walk in here with a beat up case
taylor_swift	The same guitar I've always played
taylor_swift	And the words I wrote down on a page
taylor_swift	When I was 12 years old and small town raised
taylor_swift	You tell the crowd you're paying dues
taylor_swift	I'd tell them this is what I do
taylor_swift	And it's what I put my life into
taylor_swift	As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
taylor_swift	They say life on music row is rough conditions
taylor_swift	Oh, but the easy ride was never my ambition
taylor_swift	I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
taylor_swift	Let's talk about what you do that I can't
taylor_swift	Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
taylor_swift	And who wins
taylor_swift	Let's talk about what you did to get here
taylor_swift	Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
taylor_swift	Let's talk about what you wanna be
taylor_swift	And who I've always been
taylor_swift	Let's talk about your childhood days
taylor_swift	You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
taylor_swift	So where's that crown gotten you these days?
taylor_swift	When it's me and you and the same damn games
taylor_swift	So what've you got that I ain't?
taylor_swift	And what do you do that I can't?
taylor_swift	Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
taylor_swift	Let's talk about what you did to get here
taylor_swift	Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
taylor_swift	Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl
taylor_swift	And who I've always been
taylor_swift	He said, "Let's get out of this town"
taylor_swift	Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
taylor_swift	I thought heaven can't help me now
taylor_swift	Nothing lasts forever
taylor_swift	But this is gonna take me down
taylor_swift	He's so tall and handsome as hell
taylor_swift	He's so bad but he does it so well
taylor_swift	I can see the end as it begins
taylor_swift	My one condition is...
taylor_swift	Say you'll remember me
taylor_swift	Standing in a nice dress
taylor_swift	Staring at the sunset, babe
taylor_swift	Red lips and rosy cheeks
taylor_swift	Say you'll see me again
taylor_swift	Even if it's just in your
taylor_swift	Wildest dreams...
taylor_swift	Wildest dreams...
taylor_swift	I said, "No one has to know what we do"
taylor_swift	His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
taylor_swift	And his voice is a familiar sound
taylor_swift	Nothing lasts forever
taylor_swift	But this is getting good now
taylor_swift	He's so tall and handsome as hell
taylor_swift	He's so bad but he does it so well
taylor_swift	And when we've had our very last kiss
taylor_swift	My last request is...
taylor_swift	Say you'll remember me
taylor_swift	Standing in a nice dress
taylor_swift	Staring at the sunset, babe
taylor_swift	Red lips and rosy cheeks
taylor_swift	Say you'll see me again
taylor_swift	Even if it's just in your
taylor_swift	Wildest dreams...
taylor_swift	Wildest dreams...
taylor_swift	You'll see me in hindsight
taylor_swift	Tangled up with you all night
taylor_swift	Burning it down
taylor_swift	Someday when you leave me
taylor_swift	I'll bet these memories
taylor_swift	Follow you around
taylor_swift	You'll see me in hindsight
taylor_swift	Tangled up with you all night
taylor_swift	Burning it down (down)
taylor_swift	Someday when you leave me
taylor_swift	I'll bet these memories
taylor_swift	Follow you around (follow you around)
taylor_swift	Say you'll remember me
taylor_swift	Standing in a nice dress
taylor_swift	Staring at the sunset, babe
taylor_swift	Red lips and rosy cheeks
taylor_swift	Say you'll see me again
taylor_swift	Even if it's just pretend...
taylor_swift	Say you'll remember me
taylor_swift	Standing in a nice dress
taylor_swift	Staring at the sunset, babe
taylor_swift	Red lips and rosy cheeks
taylor_swift	Say you'll see me again
taylor_swift	Even if it's just in your
taylor_swift	(Just pretend, just pretend)
taylor_swift	Wildest dreams...
taylor_swift	In your wildest dreams...
taylor_swift	(Even if just real in your)
taylor_swift	Wildest dreams...
taylor_swift	In your wildest dreams...
taylor_swift	Flashing lights and we
taylor_swift	Took a wrong turn and we
taylor_swift	Fell down the rabbit hole
taylor_swift	You held on tight to me
taylor_swift	'Cause nothing's as it seems
taylor_swift	I'm spinning out of control
taylor_swift	Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
taylor_swift	Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
taylor_swift	Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
taylor_swift	Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
taylor_swift	I felt your arms twisting around me
taylor_swift	I should've slept with one eye open that night
taylor_swift	We found Wonderland
taylor_swift	You and I got lost in it
taylor_swift	And we pretended it
taylor_swift	Could last forever, eh
taylor_swift	We found Wonderland
taylor_swift	You and I got lost in it
taylor_swift	And life was never worse
taylor_swift	But never better, eh
taylor_swift	In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
taylor_swift	In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
taylor_swift	In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
taylor_swift	In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
taylor_swift	So we went on our way
taylor_swift	Too in love to think straight
taylor_swift	All alone or so it seemed
taylor_swift	But there were strangers watching
taylor_swift	And whispers turned to talking
taylor_swift	And talking turned to screams
taylor_swift	Oh, didn't they tell us, "Don't rush into things?"
taylor_swift	Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
taylor_swift	Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
taylor_swift	Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
taylor_swift	I felt your arms twisting around me
taylor_swift	It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind
taylor_swift	Oh, darling, we found Wonderland
taylor_swift	You and I got lost in it
taylor_swift	And we pretended it
taylor_swift	Could last forever, eh
taylor_swift	We found Wonderland
taylor_swift	You and I got lost in it
taylor_swift	And life was never worse
taylor_swift	But never better, eh
taylor_swift	In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
taylor_swift	In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
taylor_swift	In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
taylor_swift	In Wonderland
taylor_swift	I reach for you, but you were gone
taylor_swift	I knew I had to go back home
taylor_swift	You searched the world for something else
taylor_swift	To make you feel like what we had
taylor_swift	And in the end, in Wonderland
taylor_swift	We both went mad
taylor_swift	We found Wonderland
taylor_swift	You and I got lost in it
taylor_swift	And we pretended it
taylor_swift	Could last forever (last forever)
taylor_swift	We found Wonderland
taylor_swift	You and I got lost in it
taylor_swift	And life was never worse
taylor_swift	But never better (never better)
taylor_swift	We found Wonderland
taylor_swift	You and I got lost in it
taylor_swift	And we pretended it
taylor_swift	Could last forever
taylor_swift	We found Wonderland
taylor_swift	You and I got lost in it
taylor_swift	And life was never worse
taylor_swift	But never better
taylor_swift	In Wonderland
taylor_swift	Jesus, Jesus, precious is your name
taylor_swift	When you dwell in the fullness
taylor_swift	Of your trinity the Lord
taylor_swift	Crush me till the oil flows like rain
taylor_swift	Healing my pain
taylor_swift	Let the oil flow like rain
taylor_swift	Crush me till the oil flows like rain
taylor_swift	Healing my pain
taylor_swift	Let the oil flow like rain
taylor_swift	There's a healing in the house
taylor_swift	Healing in the house
taylor_swift	He has come to mend the broken-hearted
taylor_swift	Healing in the house
taylor_swift	There is joy in the house
taylor_swift	Joy in the house
taylor_swift	He has come to mend the broken-hearted
taylor_swift	Joy in the house
taylor_swift	There is joy in the house
taylor_swift	Joy in the house
taylor_swift	He has come to mend the broken-hearted
taylor_swift	Joy in the house
taylor_swift	Blessed be the father, the god of all creation
taylor_swift	Blessed be the father, who reigns forevermore
taylor_swift	Who reigns forevermore...
taylor_swift	I can't believe you did it again, walk by and took my heart with you
taylor_swift	Why'd you have to look so good, don't you know I'm trying to hate you
taylor_swift	Tryin' to have a dream without you in it, but how can I put out this fire
taylor_swift	When you're the one that lit it?
taylor_swift	I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
taylor_swift	I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do
taylor_swift	I keep writing songs about you
taylor_swift	I got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you baby
taylor_swift	Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy
taylor_swift	Something I can get out of my head
taylor_swift	I write your name, I write your name, and I tear it all to shreds
taylor_swift	I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
taylor_swift	I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do
taylor_swift	I keep writing songs about you
taylor_swift	And if you ever change your mind you want me back again
taylor_swift	I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in
taylor_swift	I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay, cause I'm not
taylor_swift	I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do
taylor_swift	I'll just wait for the day, I'll stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
taylor_swift	I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do
taylor_swift	I keep writing songs about you.
taylor_swift	All this time I was wasting
taylor_swift	Hoping you would come around
taylor_swift	I've been giving out chances every time
taylor_swift	And all you do is let me down
taylor_swift	And it's taken me this long
taylor_swift	Baby, but I've figured you out
taylor_swift	And you thinking we'll be fine again
taylor_swift	But not this time around
taylor_swift	You don't have to call anymore
taylor_swift	I won't pick up the phone
taylor_swift	This is the last straw
taylor_swift	Don't want to hurt anymore
taylor_swift	And you can tell me that you're sorry
taylor_swift	But I don't believe you, baby 
taylor_swift	Like I did before
taylor_swift	You're not sorry, no, no, no, no
taylor_swift	Looking so innocent
taylor_swift	I might believe you if I didn't know
taylor_swift	Could have loved you all my life
taylor_swift	If you hadn't left me waiting  in the cold
taylor_swift	And you've got your share of secrets
taylor_swift	And I'm tired of being last to know
taylor_swift	And now you're asking me to listen
taylor_swift	'Cause it's worked each time before
taylor_swift	But you don't have to call anymore
taylor_swift	I won't pick up the phone
taylor_swift	This is the last straw
taylor_swift	Don't want to hurt anymore
taylor_swift	And you can tell me that you're sorry
taylor_swift	But I don't believe you, baby 
taylor_swift	Like I did before
taylor_swift	You're not sorry, no, no
taylor_swift	You're not sorry, no, no
taylor_swift	You had me crawling for you, honey
taylor_swift	And it never would have gone away, no
taylor_swift	You used to shine so bright
taylor_swift	But I watched all of it fade
taylor_swift	So you don't have to call anymore
taylor_swift	I won't pick up the phone
taylor_swift	This is the last straw
taylor_swift	There's nothing left to beg for
taylor_swift	And you can tell me that you're sorry
taylor_swift	But I don't believe you, baby
taylor_swift	Like I did before
taylor_swift	You're not sorry, no, no
taylor_swift	You're not sorry, no, no
taylor_swift	One look, dark room
taylor_swift	Meant just for you
taylor_swift	Time moved too fast
taylor_swift	You play it back
taylor_swift	Buttons on a coat
taylor_swift	Lighthearted joke
taylor_swift	No proof, not much
taylor_swift	But you saw enough
taylor_swift	Small talk, he drives
taylor_swift	Coffee at midnight
taylor_swift	The light reflects
taylor_swift	The chain on your neck
taylor_swift	He says look up
taylor_swift	And your shoulders brush
taylor_swift	No proof, one touch
taylor_swift	But you felt enough
taylor_swift	You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
taylor_swift	You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
taylor_swift	You can see it with the lights out, lights out
taylor_swift	You are in love, true love, you are in love
taylor_swift	Morning, his place
taylor_swift	Burnt toast, Sunday
taylor_swift	You keep his shirt
taylor_swift	He keeps his word
taylor_swift	And for once you let go
taylor_swift	Of your fears and your ghosts
taylor_swift	One step, not much
taylor_swift	But it said enough
taylor_swift	You kiss on sidewalks
taylor_swift	You fight and you talk
taylor_swift	One night he wakes
taylor_swift	Strange look on his face
taylor_swift	Pauses, then says
taylor_swift	"You're my best friend."
taylor_swift	And you knew what it was
taylor_swift	He is in love
taylor_swift	You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
taylor_swift	You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
taylor_swift	You can see it with the lights out, lights out
taylor_swift	You are in love, true love
taylor_swift	And so it goes
taylor_swift	You two are dancing
taylor_swift	In a snow globe round and round
taylor_swift	And he keeps the picture
taylor_swift	Of you in his office downtown
taylor_swift	And you understand now why they
taylor_swift	Lost their minds and fought the wars
taylor_swift	And why I've spent my whole life
taylor_swift	Tryin' to put it into words
taylor_swift	'Cause you can hear in the silence
taylor_swift	You can feel it on the way home
taylor_swift	You can see it with the lights out
taylor_swift	You are in love, true love
taylor_swift	You're in love
taylor_swift	You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
taylor_swift	You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
taylor_swift	You can see it with the lights out, lights out
taylor_swift	You are in love, true love, you are in love
taylor_swift	You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
taylor_swift	You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
taylor_swift	You can see it with the lights out, lights out
taylor_swift	You are in love, true love, you are in love
taylor_swift	You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
taylor_swift	She's going off about something that you said
taylor_swift	'Cause she doesn't get your humor
taylor_swift	Like I do
taylor_swift	I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
taylor_swift	I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
taylor_swift	And she'll never know your story
taylor_swift	Like I do
taylor_swift	But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
taylor_swift	She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
taylor_swift	Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
taylor_swift	That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
taylor_swift	If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
taylor_swift	Been here all along, so why can't you see
taylor_swift	You belong with me?
taylor_swift	You belong with me
taylor_swift	Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
taylor_swift	I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
taylor_swift	Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
taylor_swift	Hey, isn't this easy?
taylor_swift	And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
taylor_swift	I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
taylor_swift	You say you're fine, I know you better than that
taylor_swift	Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?
taylor_swift	She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
taylor_swift	She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
taylor_swift	Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
taylor_swift	That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
taylor_swift	If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

the_beatles	'' '''''''' ''''''''
the_beatles	I read the news today, oh boy
the_beatles	About a lucky man who made the grade
the_beatles	And though the news was rather sad
the_beatles	Well, I just had to laugh
the_beatles	I saw the photograph
the_beatles	He blew his mind out in a car
the_beatles	He didn't notice that the lights had changed
the_beatles	A crowd of people stood and stared
the_beatles	They'd seen his face before
the_beatles	Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
the_beatles	I saw a film today, oh boy
the_beatles	The English army had just won the war
the_beatles	A crowd of people turned away
the_beatles	But I just had to look
the_beatles	Having read the book
the_beatles	I'd love to turn you on
the_beatles	(One)
the_beatles	Woke up, fell out of bed
the_beatles	Dragged a comb across my head
the_beatles	Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
the_beatles	And looking up, I noticed I was late
the_beatles	(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
the_beatles	Found my coat and grabbed my hat
the_beatles	Made the bus in seconds flat
the_beatles	Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
the_beatles	And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
the_beatles	Ah, ah ah ah
the_beatles	Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
the_beatles	Ah
the_beatles	Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
the_beatles	I read the news today, oh boy
the_beatles	Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
the_beatles	And though the holes were rather small
the_beatles	They had to count them all
the_beatles	Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
the_beatles	I'd love to turn you on
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	And I've been working like a dog
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	I should be sleeping like a log
the_beatles	But when I get home to you
the_beatles	I find the things that you do
the_beatles	Will make me feel all right
the_beatles	You know I work all day
the_beatles	To get you money to buy you things
the_beatles	And it's worth it just to hear you say
the_beatles	You're gonna give me everything
the_beatles	So why on earth should I moan?
the_beatles	'Cause when I get you alone
the_beatles	You know I'll feel okay
the_beatles	When I'm home
the_beatles	Everything seems to be right
the_beatles	When I'm home
the_beatles	Feeling you holding me tight
the_beatles	Tight, yeah
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	And I've been working like a dog
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	I should be sleeping like a log
the_beatles	But when I get home to you
the_beatles	I find the things that you do
the_beatles	Will make me feel all right
the_beatles	Ow!
the_beatles	So why on earth should I moan?
the_beatles	'Cause when I get you alone
the_beatles	You know I feel okay
the_beatles	When I'm home
the_beatles	Everything seems to be right
the_beatles	When I'm home
the_beatles	Feeling you holding me tight
the_beatles	Tight, yeah
the_beatles	Ooh, it's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	And I've been working like a dog
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	I should be sleeping like a log
the_beatles	But when I get home to you
the_beatles	I find the things that you do
the_beatles	Will make me feel all right
the_beatles	You know, I feel all right
the_beatles	You know, I feel all right
the_beatles	All I've got is a picture of you
the_beatles	Now that you've gone and left me blue
the_beatles	You don't hear me cry at night
the_beatles	And say sweet things to you
the_beatles	You don't hear me sing a love song to
the_beatles	A picture of you
the_beatles	I pretend that you're still here with me
the_beatles	Laughing just the way we used to be
the_beatles	But pictures they can't talk and they can't see
the_beatles	I know I'm in love and nothing more
the_beatles	Nothing more
the_beatles	I hope you'll be happy where you are
the_beatles	But if you need me I won't be to far
the_beatles	Standing in the shadow of my dreams
the_beatles	They say it's not as bad as it may seem
the_beatles	But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do
the_beatles	They don't realise that all I got
the_beatles	Is a picture of you
the_beatles	Well, if your hands start a-clapping and your fingers start a-popping
the_beatles	And your feet start a-moving around
the_beatles	And if you start to swing and sway when the band start to play
the_beatles	A real cool and way-out sound
the_beatles	And if you get the Can't Help It, when you can't sit down
the_beatles	You feel like you gotta move around
the_beatles	You get a shot of rhythm and blues
the_beatles	With just a little rock and roll on the side
the_beatles	Just for good measure
the_beatles	You get a pair of dancing shoes
the_beatles	Well, with your lover by your side
the_beatles	Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure?
the_beatles	Don't you worry 'bout a thing, when you start to dance and sing
the_beatles	Until bumps come up on you
the_beatles	And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets her, too
the_beatles	Well, here's the thing for you to do
the_beatles	Get a shot of rhythm and blues
the_beatles	With just a little rock and roll on the side

the_beatles	(P): Hello, everybody, this is Paul, and I'd just like to thank you all for buying our records during the past year. We know you've been buying 'em because the sales      have been very good, you see. Don't know where we'd be without you, really though.
the_beatles	(J): In the army, perhaps.
the_beatles	(P): Oh, we hope you've enjoyed listening to the records as much as we've enjoyed melting them - No, no, no, that's worng. - making them. We're in No. 2 studio at the      moment, at EMI, taping this little message for you.
the_beatles	(J): Yes, we are.
the_beatles	(P): We are indeed. I just thought I'd make that... This is the same studio we've used all along - since the old days of "Love Me Do" - many years ago it seems, doesn't it?
the_beatles	(J): Ah, those were the days ...
the_beatles	(P): Well, that's about all, I think. Except, to wish you all a Happy Christmas and a very New Year! Now I'll pass you over to John. John!
the_beatles	(J): John. John speakin'. Thanks all of you who bought me book. Thank you folks for buying it. It was very handy. And there's another one out pretty soon, it says here. Hope you buy that, too. It'll be the usual rubbish but it won't cost much. You see, that's the bargain we're going to strike up. I write them in my spare time, it says here. It's been a busy year ....
the_beatles	(P): Did you write this yourself?
the_beatles	(J): No! It's somebody's bad handwriter. It's been a busy year Beatle peadles, one way and another. But it's been a great year, too. You fans have seen to that. Page 2.      Thanks a lot folks and a hap-py, ah, Christmas and a merry goo-year. Crimble maybe. And I'll hand you to George who will speak to you - now!
the_beatles	(G): Thank you John. Thank you. Hi there! I'd like to thank all of you for going to see the film. 'spect a lot of you saw it more than once.
the_beatles	(R): I did.
the_beatles	(G): Did you? So did I. Thanks anyway. 'Cause it makes us very pleased, ya know. We had a quiet time making it. Actually, we didn't. We had a great time making it. And we're glad it turned out okay. The next one should be completely different. We start shooting it in February. This time it's gonna be in color.
the_beatles	(J): Green.
the_beatles	(G): It'll be a big laugh we hope. (Ha ha ha!) Well, we ... Big laugh, ha ha ha, yeah, it'll be a big laugh.
the_beatles	(J): Be a big laugh, you imagine?
the_beatles	(G): And we may see all of you soon. Hope so anyway. All the best. And, happy New Year. And a Happy Christmas. And here's Ringo.
the_beatles	(R): Thanks, Geroge. Ringo here. Well, the others have thanked you for all the discs and John's book and for everything - oh, no - for enjoying the film. I'd like to thank you just for being fans. It's been a funny year, you know. One minute we're in England, next, we're away. 'spect you're wondering where we've been. Well, Beatle people, we've been to Australia and America and New (Who's dropping that?) New Zealand. And Australia.
the_beatles	(P): And New Zealand.
the_beatles	(R): Ha ha! Or is that New Zealand?
the_beatles	(P): So much travelling! But you've stayed loyal, haven't you?
the_beatles	(R): Anyway, those airport receptions knocked us out, man, great!
the_beatles	(J): Dig!
the_beatles	(R): Well, that's about it from me. I'd just like to say, all the best for Christmas and happy new year.

the_beatles	She'll be knocking on my door. 
the_beatles	In the evening when the sun goes down 
the_beatles	And there ain't nobody else around,

the_beatles	The man in the crowd with the multi-coloured mirror's on his hobnail boots
the_beatles	Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime
the_beatles	A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust

the_beatles	this time I will try to show that I'm
the_beatles	not trying to pretend.
the_beatles	I thought that you would realize--
the_beatles	John: It's too hard to sing!
the_beatles	(growls):
the_beatles	That if I ran away from you,
the_beatles	that you would want me--
the_beatles	John: When I start going 'woh, woh' about eight times.
the_beatles	Paul: I just want to sing that bit.
the_beatles	John: One, two, three...
the_beatles	The sun is fading away
the_beatles	That's the end of the day
the_beatles	As the June light turns to moonlight
the_beatles	I'll be on my way
the_beatles	Just one kiss and I'll go
the_beatles	Don't hide the tears that don't show
the_beatles	As the June light turns to moonlight
the_beatles	I'll be on my way
the_beatles	To where the winds don't blow
the_beatles	And golden rivers flow
the_beatles	This way will I go
the_beatles	They were right, I was wrong
the_beatles	True love didn't last long
the_beatles	As the June light turns to moonlight
the_beatles	I'll be on my way
the_beatles	To where the winds don't blow
the_beatles	And golden rivers flow
the_beatles	This way will I go
the_beatles	They were right, I was wrong
the_beatles	True love didn't last long
the_beatles	As the June light turns to moonlight
the_beatles	I'll be on my way
the_beatles	I'll be on my way, oh oh oh
the_beatles	I'll be on my way, oh oh oh
the_beatles	I'll be on my way
the_beatles	I've got every reason on earth to be mad
the_beatles	'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
the_beatles	If I could get my way
the_beatles	I'd get myself locked up today
the_beatles	But I can't, so I'll cry instead
the_beatles	I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
the_beatles	I can't talk to people that I meet
the_beatles	If I could see you now
the_beatles	I'd try to make you sad somehow
the_beatles	But I can't, so I'll cry instead
the_beatles	Don't want to cry when there's people there
the_beatles	I get shy when they start to stare
the_beatles	I'm gonna hide myself away
the_beatles	But I'll come back again someday
the_beatles	And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls
the_beatles	I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
the_beatles	Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
the_beatles	And show you what your loving man can do
the_beatles	Until then, I'll cry instead
the_beatles	Don't want to cry when there's people there
the_beatles	I get shy when they start to stare
the_beatles	I'm gonna hide myself away

the_beatles	'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
the_beatles	Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two

the_beatles	Until then, I'll cry instead
the_beatles	One day you'll look 
the_beatles	To see I've gone
the_beatles	For tomorrow may rain, so
the_beatles	I'll follow the sun
the_beatles	Some day you'll know 
the_beatles	I was the one
the_beatles	But tomorrow may rain, so
the_beatles	I'll follow the sun
the_beatles	And now the time has come
the_beatles	And so, my love, I must go
the_beatles	And though I lose a friend
the_beatles	In the end you will know, oh

the_beatles	It's easy 'cause I know 
the_beatles	I've imagined I'm in love with you 
the_beatles	Many, many, many times before 
the_beatles	It's not like me to pretend 
the_beatles	But I'll get you 
the_beatles	I'll get you in the end 
the_beatles	Yes, I will
the_beatles	I'll get you in the end 
the_beatles	Oh, yeah
the_beatles	Oh, yeah
the_beatles	I think about you night and day 
the_beatles	I need you and it's true 
the_beatles	When I think about you I can say 
the_beatles	I'm never, never, never, never blue 
the_beatles	So I'm telling you, my friend 
the_beatles	That I'll get you 
the_beatles	I'll get you in the end 
the_beatles	Yes, I will
the_beatles	I'll get you in the end 
the_beatles	Oh, yeah
the_beatles	Oh, yeah
the_beatles	Well, there's gonna be a time 
the_beatles	When I'm gonna change your mind
the_beatles	So you might as well resign yourself to me
the_beatles	Oh, yeah
the_beatles	Imagine I'm in love with you 
the_beatles	It's easy 'cause I know

the_beatles	I'm a loser
the_beatles	I'm a loser
the_beatles	And I'm not what I appear to be
the_beatles	Of all the love I have won or have lost
the_beatles	There is one love I should never have crossed
the_beatles	She was a girl in a million, my friend
the_beatles	I should have known she would win in the end
the_beatles	I'm a loser
the_beatles	And I lost someone who's near to me
the_beatles	I'm a loser
the_beatles	And I'm not what I appear to be
the_beatles	Although I laugh and I act like a clown
the_beatles	Beneath this mask, I am wearing a frown
the_beatles	My tears are falling like rain from the sky
the_beatles	Is it for her or myself that I cry?
the_beatles	I'm a loser
the_beatles	And I lost someone who's near to me
the_beatles	I'm a loser
the_beatles	And I'm not what I appear to be
the_beatles	What have I done to deserve such a fate?

the_beatles	And I lost someone who's near to me
the_beatles	I'm a loser

the_beatles	My head is filled with things to say
the_beatles	When you're here
the_beatles	All those words, they seem to slip away
the_beatles	When I get near you
the_beatles	The games begin to drag me down
the_beatles	It's all right
the_beatles	I'll make you maybe next time around
the_beatles	But if I seem to act unkind
the_beatles	It's only me
the_beatles	It's not my mind
the_beatles	That is confusing things
the_beatles	I want to tell you
the_beatles	I feel hung up but I don't know why
the_beatles	I don't mind
the_beatles	I could wait forever
the_beatles	I've got time
the_beatles	Sometimes I wish I knew you well
the_beatles	Then I could speak my mind
the_beatles	And tell you
the_beatles	Maybe you'd understand
the_beatles	I want to tell you
the_beatles	I feel hung up and I don't know why
the_beatles	I don't mind
the_beatles	I could wait forever
the_beatles	I've got time
the_beatles	I've got time

the_beatles	Who knows how long I've loved you?
the_beatles	You know I love you still
the_beatles	Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
the_beatles	If you want me to I will
the_beatles	For if I ever saw you
the_beatles	I didn't catch your name
the_beatles	But it never really mattered
the_beatles	I will always feel the same
the_beatles	Love you forever and forever
the_beatles	Love you with all my heart
the_beatles	Love you whenever we're together
the_beatles	Love you when we're apart
the_beatles	And when at last I find you
the_beatles	Your song will fill the air

the_beatles	Oh, you know I will
the_beatles	I will
the_beatles	Mm
the_beatles	Da-da-da-da-da-da da
the_beatles	If I fell in love with you
the_beatles	Would you promise to be true
the_beatles	And help me understand?
the_beatles	'Cause I've been in love before
the_beatles	And I found that love was more
the_beatles	Than just holding hands
the_beatles	If I give my heart
the_beatles	To you
the_beatles	I must be sure
the_beatles	From the very start
the_beatles	That you
the_beatles	Would love me more than her
the_beatles	If I trust in you
the_beatles	Oh, please
the_beatles	Don't run and hide
the_beatles	If I love you too
the_beatles	Oh, please
the_beatles	Don't hurt my pride like her
the_beatles	'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
the_beatles	And I
the_beatles	Would be sad if our new love
the_beatles	Was in vain
the_beatles	So I hope you see
the_beatles	That I
the_beatles	Would love to love you
the_beatles	And that she
the_beatles	Will cry
the_beatles	When she learns we are two
the_beatles	'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
the_beatles	And I would be sad if our new love
the_beatles	Was in vain
the_beatles	So I hope you see
the_beatles	That I
the_beatles	Would love to love you
the_beatles	And that she
the_beatles	Will cry
the_beatles	When she learns we are two
the_beatles	If I fell in love with you

the_beatles	As I was slowly passing
the_beatles	An orphan's home one day,
the_beatles	I stopped for just a little while
the_beatles	To watch the children play.
the_beatles	Alone a boy was standing
the_beatles	And when I asked him why,
the_beatles	He turned with eyes that could not see
the_beatles	And he began to cry.
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child,
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child.
the_beatles	Just like the flowers
the_beatles	I'm growing wild.
the_beatles	I got no mummy's kisses
the_beatles	I got no daddy's smile.
the_beatles	Nobody wants me,
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child.
the_beatles	No mummy's arms to hold me
the_beatles	Or sue me when I cry,
the_beatles	'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome
the_beatles	I wish that I could die.
the_beatles	I'll walk the streets of heaven
the_beatles	Where all blinds can see.
the_beatles	And just like for the other kids
the_beatles	It will be a home for me.
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child,
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child.
the_beatles	Just like the flowers
the_beatles	I'm growing wild.
the_beatles	I got no mummy's kisses
the_beatles	I got no daddy's smile.
the_beatles	Nobody wants me,
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child
the_beatles	I once had a girl or should I say
the_beatles	She once had me
the_beatles	She showed me her room, isn't it good
the_beatles	Norwegian wood?
the_beatles	She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
the_beatles	So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
the_beatles	I sat on a rug biding my time
the_beatles	Drinking her wine
the_beatles	We talked until two and then she said:
the_beatles	"It's time for bed"
the_beatles	She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
the_beatles	I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
the_beatles	And when I awoke I was alone
the_beatles	This bird had flown
the_beatles	So I lit a fire, isn't it good
the_beatles	Norwegian wood?
the_beatles	You know you made me cry
the_beatles	I see no use in wondering why
the_beatles	I cry for you
the_beatles	And now you've changed your mind
the_beatles	I see no reason to change mine
the_beatles	I cry
the_beatles	It's through
the_beatles	You're giving me the same old line
the_beatles	I'm wond'ring why
the_beatles	You hurt me then
the_beatles	You're back again
the_beatles	No, no, no
the_beatles	Not a second time
the_beatles	You know you made me cry
the_beatles	I see no use in wondering why
the_beatles	I cry for you
the_beatles	And now you've changed your mind
the_beatles	I see no reason to change mine
the_beatles	I cry
the_beatles	It's through
the_beatles	You're giving me the same old line
the_beatles	I'm wond'ring why
the_beatles	You hurt me then
the_beatles	You're back again
the_beatles	No, no, no
the_beatles	Not a second time
the_beatles	Not a second time
the_beatles	Not a second time
the_beatles	No, no, no, no, no
the_beatles	No, no no (not a second time)
the_beatles	No, no, no, no, no
the_beatles	Not guilty
the_beatles	For getting in your way
the_beatles	While you're trying to steal the day
the_beatles	Not guilty
the_beatles	And I'm not here for the rest
the_beatles	I'm not trying to steal your vest
the_beatles	I'm not trying to be smart
the_beatles	I only want what I can get
the_beatles	I'm really sorry for your aging head
the_beatles	But like you heard me said
the_beatles	Not guilty
the_beatles	No use handing me a writ
the_beatles	While I'm trying to do my bit
the_beatles	I don't expect to take your heart
the_beatles	I only want what I can get
the_beatles	I'm really sorry that you're underfed
the_beatles	But like you heard me said
the_beatles	Not guilty
the_beatles	Not guilty
the_beatles	For looking like a freak
the_beatles	Making friends with every sikh
the_beatles	Not guilty
the_beatles	For leading you astray
the_beatles	On the road to Mandalay
the_beatles	I won't upset the apple cart
the_beatles	I only want what I can get
the_beatles	I'm really sorry that you've been misled
the_beatles	But like you heard me said
the_beatles	Not guilty
the_beatles	I tried to find out 
the_beatles	What love is all about, 
the_beatles	And every day 
the_beatles	It sure lets out. 
the_beatles	I see my baby 
the_beatles	I get week in my knees. 
the_beatles	There's nothing shaking 
the_beatles	But the leaves on the trees. 
the_beatles	My pappie told me 
the_beatles	There'd be times like these. 
the_beatles	There's nothing shaking 
the_beatles	But the leaves on the trees. 
the_beatles	We meet the gang 
the_beatles	And go to rocking joes. 
the_beatles	The cats are something 
the_beatles	On the heels and toes. 
the_beatles	I grab my baby, 
the_beatles	Tried to give her a squeeze. 
the_beatles	There's nothing shaking 
the_beatles	But the leaves on the trees. 
the_beatles	Why must she be 
the_beatles	Such a doggone tease? 
the_beatles	There's nothing shaking 
the_beatles	But the leaves on the trees. 
the_beatles	She's got a way 
the_beatles	That makes me act like a fool. 
the_beatles	Spent my money, 
the_beatles	Then she plays me cool. 
the_beatles	I beg her for kisses 
the_beatles	On my bended knees. 
the_beatles	Oh won't you give me 
the_beatles	Some loving, baby, 
the_beatles	Please please please. 
the_beatles	Though I keep trying hard 
the_beatles	To make her mine, 
the_beatles	One day the wind will blow 
the_beatles	And the sun will shine. 
the_beatles	Till that time 
the_beatles	She puts my heart at ease. 
the_beatles	There's nothing shaking 
the_beatles	But the leaves on the trees 
the_beatles	She locked my heart 
the_beatles	And threw away the keys. 
the_beatles	There's nothing shaking 
the_beatles	But the leaves on the trees, yeah.

the_beatles	In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
the_beatles	Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
the_beatles	And all the people that come and go
the_beatles	Stop and say hello
the_beatles	On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
the_beatles	The little children laugh at him behind his back
the_beatles	And the banker never wears a mac
the_beatles	In the pouring rain
the_beatles	Very strange
the_beatles	Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
the_beatles	There beneath the blue suburban skies
the_beatles	I sit and meanwhile back
the_beatles	In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
the_beatles	And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
the_beatles	He likes to keep his fire engine clean
the_beatles	It's a clean machine
the_beatles	Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
the_beatles	Four of fish and finger pies in summer
the_beatles	Meanwhile back
the_beatles	Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
the_beatles	A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
the_beatles	And though she feels as if she's in a play
the_beatles	She is anyway
the_beatles	In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
the_beatles	We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
the_beatles	And then the fireman rushes in
the_beatles	From the pouring rain
the_beatles	Very strange
the_beatles	Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
the_beatles	There beneath the blue suburban skies
the_beatles	I sit and meanwhile back
the_beatles	Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes

the_beatles	Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
the_beatles	There lived a young boy name o' Rocky Raccoon-a
the_beatles	And one day his woman ran off with another guy
the_beatles	Hit young Rocky in the eye
the_beatles	Rocky didn't like that
the_beatles	He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
the_beatles	So one day he walked into town
the_beatles	Booked himself a room in the local saloon
the_beatles	Rocky Raccoon
the_beatles	Checked into his room
the_beatles	Only to find Gideon's Bible
the_beatles	Rocky had come
the_beatles	Equipped with a gun
the_beatles	To shoot off the legs of his rival
the_beatles	His rival, it seems
the_beatles	Had broken his dreams
the_beatles	By stealing the girl of his fancy
the_beatles	Her name was Magill
the_beatles	And she called herself Lil
the_beatles	But everyone knew her as Nancy
the_beatles	Now, she and her man
the_beatles	Who called himself Dan
the_beatles	Were in the next room at the hoedown
the_beatles	A-Rocky burst in
the_beatles	And grinning a grin
the_beatles	He said, "Danny, boy, this is a showdown!"
the_beatles	But Daniel was hot
the_beatles	And he drew first and shot
the_beatles	And Rocky collapsed in the corner
the_beatles	Aah

the_beatles	Now the doctor came in
the_beatles	Stinking of gin
the_beatles	And proceeded to lie on the table
the_beatles	He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
the_beatles	And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
the_beatles	And I'll be better
the_beatles	I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
the_beatles	A-now Rocky Raccoon
the_beatles	He fell back in his room
the_beatles	Only to find Gideon's Bible (Daa da-da-da)
the_beatles	A-Gideon checked out (Poor)
the_beatles	And he left it no doubt (Rocky)
the_beatles	To help with good Rocky's revival (Ohhh)

the_beatles	And when I asked him why,
the_beatles	He turned with eyes that could not see
the_beatles	And he began to cry.
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child,
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child.
the_beatles	Just like the flowers
the_beatles	I'm growing wild.
the_beatles	I got no mummy's kisses

the_beatles	Nobody wants me,
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child.
the_beatles	No mummy's arms to hold me
the_beatles	Or sue me when I cry,
the_beatles	'cause sometimes I feel so lonesome
the_beatles	I wish that I could die.
the_beatles	I'll walk the streets of heaven
the_beatles	Where all blinds can see.
the_beatles	And just like for the other kids
the_beatles	It will be a home for me.
the_beatles	I'm nobody's child,

the_beatles	Standing in the dock at Southampton
the_beatles	Trying to get to Holland or France
the_beatles	The man in the mac said
the_beatles	"You've got to go back."
the_beatles	You know, they didn't even give us a chance
the_beatles	Christ, you know it ain't easy
the_beatles	You know how hard it can be
the_beatles	The way things are going
the_beatles	They're going to crucify me

the_beatles	Talking in our beds for a week
the_beatles	The news people said
the_beatles	"Say, what you doing in bed?"
the_beatles	I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"
the_beatles	Christ, you know it ain't easy
the_beatles	You know how hard it can be
the_beatles	The way things are going
the_beatles	They're going to crucify me
the_beatles	Saving up your money for a rainy day
the_beatles	Giving all your clothes to charity
the_beatles	Last night the wife said
the_beatles	"Oh boy, when you're dead
the_beatles	You don't take nothing with you but your soul
the_beatles	Think!"
the_beatles	Made a lightning trip to Vienna
the_beatles	Eating chocolate cake in a bag
the_beatles	Newspapers said
the_beatles	"She's gone to his head.
the_beatles	They look just like two gurus in drag."
the_beatles	Christ, you know it ain't easy

the_beatles	Said, "We wish you success.
the_beatles	It's good to have the both of you back."

the_beatles	(R): Hello, this is a big "Hi" and a sincere Merry Christmas from yours truly, Ringo Starr.
the_beatles	(P): (Singing)
the_beatles	Happy New Year, happy Christmas,
the_beatles	Happy Easter, happy autumn.
the_beatles	Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody,
the_beatles	Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you.
the_beatles	I'd like to wish ev'rybody happy Christmas
the_beatles	This year of 1968 going on 69.
the_beatles	Happy Christmas, happy New Year,
the_beatles	All the best to you from here.
the_beatles	Ah - haaa!
the_beatles	I'd like to wish ev'rybody
the_beatles	Happy Christmas, happy New Year.
the_beatles	From there to here,
the_beatles	Happy New Year, happy New Year,
the_beatles	Happy New Year, happy New Year.
the_beatles	When I get to the bottom
the_beatles	I go back to the top of the slide,
the_beatles	Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
the_beatles	Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.
the_beatles	(J): Once upon a time, there were two balloons called
the_beatles	Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
the_beatles	in a million years. They were together man. Unfortunate
the_beatles	timetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
the_beatles	kept calling them one way or another. You know how it is.
the_beatles	But they battled on against overwhelming oddities,
the_beatles	including some of their beast friends. Being in love,
the_beatles	they clung together even more man. But some of the
the_beatles	poisonous monsters' outdated boss - lordy ape claws did
the_beatles	stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
the_beatles	the dry cleaners. Luckily, this did not kill them and
the_beatles	they weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
the_beatles	hopefully ever after and who could blame them?
the_beatles	(G): Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas
the_beatles	time is here again. Ain't been around since last year.
the_beatles	And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from
the_beatles	America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful,
the_beatles	beloved fans all over the world who have made our life
the_beatles	worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who
the_beatles	through thick and thin would surely like to say a word
the_beatles	of greeting at this festive occasion.
the_beatles	(M): Merry Christmas children everywhere!
the_beatles	(?): At the first stroke, it will be ...
the_beatles	(R): ... Ringo Starr. Thank you!
the_beatles	"Good evening."
the_beatles	"Hello me dear. I didn't know you were coming."
the_beatles	"I'm not surprised."
the_beatles	"Well, I am! Certainly am!"
the_beatles	"I would have thought so myself."
the_beatles	"Well, if you ask me, I think it's insane."
the_beatles	"Occasionally."
the_beatles	"Yes, me, too. Twice a week sometimes."
the_beatles	"Fourteen and six."
the_beatles	"Nineteen and five to save me if you don't mind."
the_beatles	"Yes, I know."
the_beatles	"Don't you say yes to me! I'm telling you!"
the_beatles	"This is a private line, you know."
the_beatles	"Private line? I've been on this line for two years."
the_beatles	(R): Well, it's my proud pleasure tonight to introduce one of
the_beatles	the most versatile performers in our career. And he's
the_beatles	come all the way from Stokely Carmichel's -on-Sea.
the_beatles	And I hope you're going to like him. Let's give him a
the_beatles	big hand ...
the_beatles	(P): (Singing)
the_beatles	Happy New Year, happy Christmas,
the_beatles	Happy Easter, happy autumn,
the_beatles	Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody,
the_beatles	Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you.
the_beatles	(J): Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired
the_beatles	butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in
the_beatles	scented cesspool or be careful. Her father was in a
the_beatles	long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence.
the_beatles	We're indebted to the colloquial office for its immediate
the_beatles	disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, half a
the_beatles	fell of her twotem (*hoc virtallo a totem?). On the other handbag, I mean to say
the_beatles	l'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking.
the_beatles	For this film is about an hourglass houseboat. The full
the_beatles	meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their
the_beatles	loss was our Gainsborough nil.
the_beatles	(J (Double Tracked)):
the_beatles	The sound of a manservantile defectively lasting barred
the_beatles	up in a love-dizzy gar-di-dell time. How close can you
the_beatles	Gettysburg and ever underly council ya originally a
the_beatles	birdbath feeling?
the_beatles	(G): Cut! 
the_beatles	We have a special guest here this evening, Mr.
the_beatles	Tiny Tim. I'd like to ask him to say a few words.
the_beatles	(T): Oh, hello to you nice Beatles. Ah, it's so wonderful,
the_beatles	what a thrill it is talking here. Ah, in Mr. Harrison's
the_beatles	presence, Mr. Weiss' presence, and all his nice wonderful
the_beatles	friends. And the thing is, I just wanna say Merry
the_beatles	Christmas to you all. And, ah, a Happy New Year.
the_beatles	(G): Thank you, Tiny. Would you like to sing us a little song?
the_beatles	(T): Ah, I'd love to. Here's a song I did in 1966 in front of
the_beatles	Miss Jill for the first time. And I did this in Albert
the_beatles	Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and
the_beatles	now ... exactly the way I did it then.
the_beatles	(Singing) 
the_beatles	He's a, ooh, real nowhere man,
the_beatles	Living in his nowhere land,
the_beatles	Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
the_beatles	Hasn't got a point of view,
the_beatles	Knows not where he's going to,
the_beatles	Isn't he a bit like you and me?
the_beatles	Nowhere man, (yes?) Don't worry,
the_beatles	Take your time, don't hurry,
the_beatles	Nowhere man, the world's at your command, ooh.
the_beatles	He's a, huh huh, real nowhere man,
the_beatles	Living in his nowhere land,
the_beatles	Making all his nowhere plans for nobody, ooh, ooh.
the_beatles	(G): Thank you, Tiny. Thank you and God bless you, Tiny.
the_beatles	(T): God bless you all. Oh, God bless you all.
the_beatles	Ho!
the_beatles	Good King Wenceslas looked out
the_beatles	On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!)
the_beatles	As the slow ray round about
the_beatles	Deep and crisp and crispy
the_beatles	Brightly show the boot last night
the_beatles	On the mosty cruel
the_beatles	Henry Hall and David Lloyd
the_beatles	Betty Grable too-oo-oo
the_beatles	Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!)
the_beatles	We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already. But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show. This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because "Love Me Do" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:
the_beatles	Garry Crimble to you
the_beatles	Garry Mimble to you
the_beatles	Getty Bable, dear Christmas
the_beatles	Happy Birthday me too
the_beatles	This is Paul here.
the_beatles	Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like jelly babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off jelly babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing. (Yes! Yes! Oh yes!)
the_beatles	Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio (yes, we enjoy that very kindly) to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop, (Stop! Stop!) and Ringo, (Stop! Stop! Shouting those animals!) so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription.
the_beatles	Ja, das wird uns danke schon
the_beatles	Und denn gruss von even
the_beatles	Ja, denn gruss von even schon
the_beatles	Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy
the_beatles	Danke schon
the_beatles	Ja, Ringo!
the_beatles	Hello, Ringo here. 
the_beatles	As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups... (Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas) Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted.
the_beatles	(Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas)
the_beatles	King Wenceslas:
the_beatles	Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
the_beatles	On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
the_beatles	When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)
the_beatles	Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!)
the_beatles	Hooray!
the_beatles	Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
the_beatles	I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters.
the_beatles	And I'd just like to say:
the_beatles	Brightly was the shone that night
the_beatles	Though the winter cruel
the_beatles	When a pork pie came inside
the_beatles	Gathering winter cruel

the_beatles	Ha, ha, ha, ha...
the_beatles	Oh yeah! Oh!
the_beatles	Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!)
the_beatles	Had a very shiny nose
the_beatles	Merry Christmas everybody!

the_beatles	For this tape, eh?
the_beatles	(?): Happy Christmas?
the_beatles	(J): Yeah. Go on. One, two, three.
the_beatles	(All): Happy Christmas!
the_beatles	(J): Thank you. Same to you. Ha, ha. Happy Christmas.
the_beatles	(Yoko): ... Christmas, John, and I see you strolling in
the_beatles	Ascot Garden with your wife, Yoko, but well, do you
the_beatles	Have any special thoughts at, for Christmas?
the_beatles	(J): Well, Yoko, it is Christmas and my special thoughts,
the_beatles	Of course, turn towards eating.
the_beatles	(Y): Ha! Ha! Ha! All right. So, eating. Well, what do you like to eat?
the_beatles	(J): Well, I'd like some cornflakes prepared by Parisian
the_beatles	Hands. And I'd like it blessed by Hari Krishna Mantra.
the_beatles	(G): "Yes, have a wonderful Christmas.     
the_beatles	Have a jolly new year.
the_beatles	Make sure that Christmas...
the_beatles	... comes once a year."
the_beatles	Yes, Happy New Year. All the best.
the_beatles	This is George Harrison saying Happy Christmas. Happy
the_beatles	Christmas. Christmas. Christmas. Happy. Happy...
the_beatles	(R): (Singing)
the_beatles	Ooh, good evening to you ladies,

the_beatles	(Y): So, how do you like the garden here?
the_beatles	(J): I think it's simply splendid. I'm overwhelmed by its
the_beatles	Sanctuary.
the_beatles	(Y): So, you don't mind these high gates and things and the walls?
the_beatles	(J): Oh, I've always loved the high walls. The Elizabethan high
the_beatles	Wall is something I've always loved. You see
the_beatles	(Y): Yes
the_beatles	(J): Lady
